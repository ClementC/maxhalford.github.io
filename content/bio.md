Hello 👋

I'm a data analyst/engineer/scientist working at [Alan](https://alan.com/). I'm half British 🇬🇧 and half Belgian 🇧🇪. I went to university in Toulouse, France 🇫🇷. My academic 🎓 background is a mix of maths 🧮, economics 💸, and computer science 🖥️. I got hooked into data science in 2014 after watching [Moneyball](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Moneyball_(film)) ⚾ and reading [The Signal and the Noise](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Signal_and_the_Noise) 📖. My PhD was at the intersection of database query optimisation and machine learning 🤖. I'm more of Swiss Army knife 🇨🇭 than a one-trick pony 🐴. Indeed I'm keen on building an interest in different topics, although I do have an area of mild expertise, which is [online machine learning](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning).

I enjoy programming and I [maintain some open-source projects](https://github.com/MaxHalford/). In particular, I'm one of the founding members as well as a core maintainer of [River](https://github.com/online-ml/river) 🌊, which is a Python 🐍 library for online machine learning. I'm also a [Kaggle competitions Master](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhalford) 🏆 and enjoy competitive data science.

Besides work, I like spending time with my buddies, reading 📚, watching movies 🍿, walking, looking at -- and sometimes making -- modern art, and cooking 🍲. My favorite food is peanut butter 🥜 and my favorite beer is Guinness ☘️. I have a [brother](https://jack.0x5.be/) who's into physics and operating systems (nerd alert). My mother runs a quirky restaurant in the French countryside called the [Ziboinboin](https://ziboinboin.com/).

If you have any enquiries or simply want to get in touch, then feel free to shoot me an email at [maxhalford25@gmail.com](mailto:maxhalford25@gmail.com).
