"Ther' ain't no question 'bout it in my mind."	"twain"
"Glory be to goodness, we're shut of them!"	"twain"
"They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to."	"twain"
"But it warn't so this time."	"twain"
"These sparks was our clockthe first one that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away."	"twain"

"En you ain' deadyou ain' drowndedyou's back agin?"	"twain"
"He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who."	"twain"
"But what I say is this:  it ain't good sense to go court'n around after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's jist as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks."	"twain"
"We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped."	"twain"

"Warnings to the people that something is up."	"twain"
"Then pretty soon he says: Come to think, the logs ain't a-going to do; they don't have log walls in a dungeon:  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock."	"twain"
"By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can't."	"twain"
"No, sah, I hain't said a word."	"twain"
"Well, next day they found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done."	"twain"

"He has got use for it."	"twain"
"He dressed Jim up in King Lear's outfitit was a long curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days."	"twain"
"And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and a rattling good honest day's work:  and hungry?oh, no, I reckon not!"	"twain"
"I haven't got it in the bookI've only got one volumebut I reckon I can piece it out from memory."	"twain"
"And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he said, because they never all slept at one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over."	"twain"
"A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one."	"twain"
"My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it."	"twain"

"There warn't anything to say."	"twain"

"Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?"	"twain"
"Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names of, and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing."	"twain"
"IIthought you'd like it."	"twain"
"He was well born, as the saying is, and that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more quality than a mudcat himself."	"twain"
"Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this time."	"twain"
"Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first."	"twain"
"But before they got in I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come."	"twain"
"He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again, with his gray hair a-flying."	"twain"
"Why, a man's safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kindas long as it's daytime and you're not behind him."	"twain"

"The ridge our cavern was in was full of them."	"twain"
"The reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot."	"twain"
"The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says: Yes, Mars Sid, A dog."	"twain"
"He says: I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a corn-shuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep on."	"twain"

"I wouldn't 'low no nigger to call me dat."	"twain"
"But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking."	"twain"

"If you want to know, go and find out."	"twain"
"He came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one."	"twain"
"IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down into the woods; because Tom said we got to have some light to see how to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place."	"twain"
"They're so confiding and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all."	"twain"

"they ain't a-goin to suffer."	"twain"
"I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket."	"twain"
"Then his next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that."	"twain"
"We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on their tails, and let on they're rattlesnakes, and I reckon that 'll have to do."	"twain"
"If they didn't find them I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think about nothing else."	"twain"

"twain"
"Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up; but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her father."	"twain"

"twain"
"Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire."	"twain"
"I wished the widow knowed about it."	"twain"
"But dis one do smell so like de nation, Huck."	"twain"

"Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful."	"twain"
"The young chap was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather."	"twain"

"I reckon maybeI don't know."	"twain"
"She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place."	"twain"

"Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said we'd got to have it; so he took a think."	"twain"
"He says: Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed."	"twain"
"I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn't any good-luck signs."	"twain"
"I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he wouldn't."	"twain"
"It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we laughedonly a little kind of a low chuckle."	"twain"
"Noleastways, not all at oncethat is, I don't think I ever see them all come out at once but just one time."	"twain"

"While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might happen."	"twain"
"Jim ain't got no tin plates."	"twain"
"But you can guess, can't you?"	"twain"
"Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt."	"twain"
"So I set down and laid for him to wake."	"twain"
"If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way."	"twain"
"Why, Huck, s'pose it is considerble trouble?what you going to do?how you going to get around it?"	"twain"
"There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretchinga mighty ornery lot."	"twain"
"Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark on the paper."	"twain"
"It was Jim's voicenothing ever sounded so good before."	"twain"
"Never you mind, honey, never you mind."	"twain"
"Mos' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery."	"twain"
"I brought myself downyes, I did it myself."	"twain"
"Folks got up everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners' bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild."	"twain"
"But there's no hope that he's come; for he couldn't come and me miss him."	"twain"
"he says, kind of pettish."	"twain"
"Strike a light there, somebody."	"twain"
"Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-waterin barrels."	"twain"
"The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that didn't generly have but one hingea leather one."	"twain"

"It's all right, I says."	"twain"
"The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose."

"Then he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that, all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before."	"twain"
"Now I want to ask youif you got any reasonableness in you at allwhat kind of a show would that give him to be a hero?"	"twain"

"But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again."	"twain"
"So if we don't give them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat; won't amount to nothingwon't be nothing to it."	"twain"
"Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see."	"twain"
"And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy."	"twain"
"Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?"	"twain"
"Oh, well, that's all right, because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes."	"twain"
"I knowed what was the matter now."	"twain"
"It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn't give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we didn't seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom says: I know how to fix it."	"twain"
"Said we'd got to post Jim first."	"twain"

"It's the worst imitation I ever heard."	"twain"
"So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't."

"And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says: The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the window and the rod; but you'll be good, won't you?"	"twain"
"We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening."	"twain"
"It's right I should sufferperfectly rightI don't make any moan."	"twain"
"Well, what do you think?"	"twain"
"He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a pistol raised in his right handnot aiming it, but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky."	"twain"
"she says, what in the warld can have become of him?"	"twain"
"So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage."	"twain"
"Then he said he must start in and 'terpret it, because it was sent for a warning."	"twain"
"says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering."	"twain"
"Confound it, it's foolish, Tom."	"twain"
"But we got to have it anyway."	"twain"
"About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there was a big one, and they hailed her."	"twain"
"It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep."	"twain"
"You think you're a good deal of a big-bug, don't you?"	"twain"
"It warn't early, because I overslept."	"twain"
"I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good."	"twain"
"But she watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said Ouch!"	"twain"
"I begun to suspicion something."	"twain"
"Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim!"	"twain"
"Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit, neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times."	"twain"
"They all said itevery one of them."	"twain"
"They get all their chawing by borrowing; they say to a fellow, I wisht you'd len' me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I hadwhich is a lie pretty much everytime; it don't fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain't no stranger, so he says: You give him a chaw, did you?"	"twain"
"About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a shot at it."	"twain"
"So I said I would go for it."	"twain"
"We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and gradual."	"twain"
"So I come down the ladder and started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls' room the door was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she'd been packing things in itgetting ready to go to England."	"twain"
"Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?"	"twain"
"There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe there was going to be trouble."	"twain"
"He said it warn't no use talking, heathens don't amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with."	"twain"

"I thought till I wore my head sore, but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble."	"twain"
"Well, he says, there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand by and see the rules brokebecause right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows better."	"twain"
"And then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile, and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he'd be blamed if he'd ever do it again."	"twain"
"Jim won't ever forgit you, Huck; you's de bes' fren' Jim's ever had; en you's de only fren' ole Jim's got now."	"twain"
"The for'rard end, mum."	"twain"
"We would a took the bottle, but it was broke."	"twain"
"Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling around any."	"twain"
"What's de use to ax dat question?"	"twain"
"No; I take en whack de bill in two, en give half un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman."	"twain"
"And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again, say it again, say it again!"	"twain"
"Dey wuz a nigger name' Bob, dat had ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn' know it; en I bought it off'n him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en' er de year come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de bank's busted."	"twain"
"One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said Shall I Never See Thee More Alas."	"twain"
"Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how."	"twain"

"We went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do."	"twain"
"Den he cain't git no situation."	"twain"
"I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says to myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway, says I, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt."	"twain"
"They would all come handy by and by, I judged."	"twain"
"No, I ain't out of my head; I know all what I'm talking about."	"twain"
"We judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever."	"twain"
"Yes, you're all right; you're fixed very well."	"twain"
"There ain't but one; how we set the runaway nigger freeme and Tom."	"twain"
"They all asked me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died, and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be here."	"twain"
"But that's always the way; it don't make no difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't got no sense, and just goes for him anyway."	"twain"
"We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't bother us."	"twain"
"That young girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her father, crying, and saying, Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him!"	"twain"
"It was beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out."	"twain"
"But per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed, it means that we keep them till they're dead."	"twain"
"Well, that may be so, and it mayn't."	"twain"
"I wanted to be left free to work my plans."	"twain"
"I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'."	"twain"
"and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder!"	"twain"
"Jim didn't like the spiders, and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it mighty warm for him."	"twain"
"The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone."	"twain"
"What you reckon I better do?"	"twain"
"Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can't ever seem to remember them, half the time, somehow."	"twain"
"I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn't a stood it all, but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two."	"twain"
"and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I judged I was gone."	"twain"
"I tried to, but the words wouldn't come."	"twain"
"By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned in and slept like dead people."	"twain"
"is he going to deceive a ship clerk?so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?"	"twain"
"By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says: Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?"	"twain"
"That law trial was a slow businessappeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it; so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding."	"twain"
"He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway."	"twain"
"Then I come back and set down again, and says: Don't you holler."	"twain"
"I thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass, partly."	"twain"
"Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one; and quicker, too."	"twain"
"But it oughtn't to be altogether my fault, because, you know, I don't see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they're on me; and I don't believe I've ever lost one of them off of me."	"twain"
"Well, it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut."	"twain"
"Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers."	"twain"
"Why, bully, it beats the Nonesuch, don't it?"	"twain"
"I was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don't ever think of that."	"twain"
"I ain't the man to stand ityou hear?"	"twain"
"Now we're trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that's a good boy."	"twain"
"So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says: Now I know how to fix it."	"twain"
"Answer up prompt nowdon't stop to study over it."	"twain"
"I forgot I was the old man's servant."	"twain"
"Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills, and sings out to me: They hain't no right to shut him up!"	"twain"
"But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim."	"twain"
"We got home all safe."	"twain"
"So he said, now for the grand bulge!"	"twain"
"There Jim laid, sound asleep on the ground."	"twain"
"Why, great goodness, there ain't no chance for 'em if they don't git off mighty quick!"	"twain"
"I bet you can't spell my name, says I. I bet you what you dare I can, says he."	"twain"
"Anyhow, there's one thingthere's more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own head."	"twain"
"they give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say, What d' I tell you?"	"twain"
"I took off the sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then."	"twain"
"Preachin's my line, too, and workin' camp-meetin's, and missionaryin' around."	"twain"
"I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out."	"twain"
"He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire."	"twain"
"The ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in close, where the bread did."	"twain"
"It got to be very late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river."	"twain"
"I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other."	"twain"
"He was here a minute ago."	"twain"
"Honest injun, I ain't, I says."	"twain"
"When they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town."	"twain"
"Well, I 'uz gwyne to spen' it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name' BalumBalum's Ass dey call him for short; he's one er dem chuckleheads, you know."	"twain"
"They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them."	"twain"
"Cut loose and let her slide!"	"twain"
"They feed him in a pan."	"twain"
"They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn't no use for me to try to learn to do right; a body that don't get started right when he's little ain't got no showwhen the pinch comes there ain't nothing to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat."	"twain"
"And we reckoned the niggers stole it!"	"twain"

"Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the island."	"twain"
"Why, Mars Tom, I doan' want no rats."	"twain"
"So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or maybe half a dozen."	"twain"
"The racket stopped, and the wave sucked back."	"twain"
"Well, you can't get your nigger, that's allso dry up your blubbering."	"twain"
"In another second I would a been aboard of her, but just then the door opened."	"twain"
"A prisoner's got to have some kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried, why, there's more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life."	"twain"
"Then he drops down on his knees, and puts his hands together and says: Doan' hurt medon't!"	"twain"
"We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg."	"twain"
"So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it."	"twain"
"I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  About what, Sid?"	"twain"

"twain"
"Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting."	"twain"
"I'll take the order and send it, along with your brother's, and then they'll know it's all right."	"twain"
"I said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them."	"twain"
"Why, child, it 'll be stole!"	"twain"
"You can get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing."	"twain"
"Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch."	"twain"
" And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Bookwhich was a good name and stated the case."	"twain"
"After breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out was that these chaps didn't know one another."	"twain"

"They said you would, and I thought you would."	"twain"
"It was pretty ornery preachingall about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet."	"twain"
"I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded ankle deep as much as another half-mile."	"twain"
"S'e, what do you think of it, Sister Hotchkiss, s'e?"	"twain"
"Neither did that other fellow."	"twain"
"Then there was a fine time."	"twain"
"She motioned me to be still, and set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind."	"twain"
"ain't it there in his bed, for a clew, after he's gone?"	"twain"
"I'm for putting him out of his troubles."	"twain"
"The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind me."	"twain"
"she says, breaking in and jumping for him, you impudent young rascal, to fool a body so and was going to hug him, but he fended her off, and says: No, not till you've asked me first."	"twain"
"We got away as soon as it was good and dark."	"twain"

"I lay he'd wait a pow'ful long time 'fo' I ast him."	"twain"
"Why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole?"	"twain"

"He was a mighty good nigger, Jim was."	"twain"
"Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was."	"twain"
"Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting, and they wouldn't think of hurting a person that pets them."	"twain"
"Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire."	"twain"
"It's thetheGentlemen, if you'll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the headline, you won't have to come a-near the raftplease do."	"twain"
"Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened again."	"twain"
"Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about his brother's last moments, and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they'd lost the twelve disciples."	"twain"
"Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get."	"twain"
"Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery."	"twain"
"No, sir, I says, I don't want to spend it."	"twain"
"There's Hobson, the Babtis' preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, andwell, there's a lot of them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets here."	"twain"
"It's as mild as goose-milk."	"twain"
"And what do you reckon they said?"	"twain"
"NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns."	"twain"

"And ain't that a big enough majority in any town?"	"twain"
"Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself."	"twain"
"Was you in there yisterday er last night?"	"twain"
"He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn't let him."	"twain"
"And I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White River, and it took us three days to fix it."	"twain"

"Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights."	"twain"
"I says: All rightthat's mighty good; they won't find me, and they'll think I've been killed, and floated down the riverthere's something up there that 'll help them think soso don't you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can."	"twain"

"I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would."	"twain"
"Jim said he would jis' 's soon have tobacker in his coffee; and found so much fault with it, and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself, and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him."

"Is I me, or who is I?"	"twain"

"The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud."	"twain"
"When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry."	"twain"
"I took it up, and held it in my hand."	"twain"
"But my lan', Mars Sid, how's I gwyne to make 'm a witch pie?"	"twain"

"How does I talk wild?"	"twain"
"Well, o' course dat nigger want' to keep me out er de business, bekase he says dey warn't business 'nough for two banks, so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en' er de year."	"twain"

"'n' who My very words, Brer Penrod!"	"twain"
"He didn't know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first."	"twain"
"She says:  Take a cheer."	"twain"
"Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on the windows:  white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink."	"twain"
"I says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold?that's what I want to know."	"twain"
"We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied: Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be."	"twain"
"Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and then they bowed and said, Our duty to you, sir, and madam; and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too."	"twain"
"It was right down awkward, and nobody didn't seem to know what to do."	"twain"
"It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race."	"twain"
"Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?"	"twain"
"And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever."	"twain"
"I don't know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it's Sakes alive, I hope it ain't Hanner?"	"twain"
"So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with."	"twain"
"Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that."	"twain"

"I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again."	"twain"

"I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to go any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done with him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him get ashore."	"twain"
"But it didn't do no good."	"twain"

"Picks and shovelswhy, they wouldn't furnish 'em to a king."	"twain"

"We went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way."	"twain"
"I couldn't, somehow, for thinking."	"twain"
"Who makes them tear around so?"	"twain"
"But it warn't surprising; because he warn't only just a farmer, he was a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was worth it, too."

"And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it."	"twain"
"The bills said: CHAPTER XXIII."	"twain"
"But when I got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea:  I judged I'd hide her good, and then, 'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot."	"twain"
"Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without saying anything but that."	"twain"
"The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor."	"twain"
"The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest if I didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes."	"twain"
"So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see we'd done anything hardly."	"twain"
"I doan' mine one er two kings, but dat's enough."	"twain"
"The duke bristles up now, and says: Oh, let up on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame' fool?"	"twain"
"Where 'bouts do you live?"	"twain"
"AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed, but Jim didn't want to."	"twain"
"And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s'pose he No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but it's all right, I've got that one."	"twain"
"Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope."	"twain"
"The man sung out: Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old foolain't you got any sense?"	"twain"
"We want to be awful square and open and above-board here, you know."	"twain"
"I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him."	"twain"
"Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most alwaysI mean he made it seem like good weather."	"twain"
"En I reck'n de wives quarrels considable; en dat 'crease de racket."	"twain"
"The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town."	"twain"
"Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some notice took of it, and reward."	"twain"
"Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread."	"twain"
"The boys jumped for the riverboth of them hurtand as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, Kill them, kill them!"	"twain"
"Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but that warn't pap's style."	"twain"
"But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, sure."	"twain"
"I couldn't answer that."	"twain"
"Well, I'd ben a-running' a little temperance revival thar 'bout a week, and was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was makin' it mighty warm for the rummies, I tell you, and takin' as much as five or six dollars a nightten cents a head, children and niggers freeand business a-growin' all the time, when somehow or another a little report got around last night that I had a way of puttin' in my time with a private jug on the sly."	"twain"
"Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there."	"twain"
"Then the doctor whirls on me and says: Are you English, too?"	"twain"
"None of the family couldn't before they died."	"twain"
"Jim said he hadn't ever seen a bigger one."	"twain"
"What makes them come here just at this runaway nigger's breakfast-time?"	"twain"
"In about a minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with."	"twain"
"We've heard considerable about these goings on down in Hookerville, but we don't know who 'twas that killed Huck Finn."	"twain"
"Oh, shucks, yes, we can spare it."	"twain"
"It's a good businessyes."	"twain"
"Mary Jane she set at the head of the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried chickens wasand all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop, and said sosaid How do you get biscuits to brown so nice?"	"twain"
"Well, he hain't come back sence, and they ain't looking for him back till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he'd get Huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit."	"twain"
"Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it."	"twain"
"And do you reckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves?"	"twain"
"The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it."	"twain"
"So Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters."	"twain"
"The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way."	"twain"
"It's a long, dusty three mile, and we can't let you walk."	"twain"
"I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people might see me and hail me."	"twain"
"'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished."	"twain"
"Well, what did you say, then?"	"twain"
"I got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out: Set her loose, Jim!"	"twain"
" But never mind, if you think it's best to tell your uncle Harvey Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane's got it or not?"	"twain"
"Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time."	"twain"
"I heard people talking at the ferry landing."	"twain"
"It shows how a body can see and don't see at the same time."	"twain"
"Why, Sally, I couldn't miss him along the roadyou know that."	"twain"
"It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise."	"twain"
"Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on."	"twain"

"twain"
"Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he was the sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon."	"twain"
"But I said, come on, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure."	"twain"
"Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting."	"twain"
"She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says: Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!"	"twain"
"We didn't like the look of it."	"twain"
"I live up there, don't I?"	"twain"
"Why can't Miss Watson fat up?"	"twain"
"I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind."	"twain"
"Who do you reckon 't is?"	"twain"
"And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it."	"twain"
"Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says: You, Tom!"	"twain"
"About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still."	"twain"
"We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot."	"twain"
"Been there ever since; afeard to come out."	"twain"
"Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no fault of mine."	"twain"
"But he'll be pooty lonesomedey ain' no kings here, is dey, Huck?"	"twain"
"Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different."	"twain"
"Tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry up and give them one they'd get into trouble sure."	"twain"
"I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark."	"twain"
"And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there and git him."	"twain"
"When she'd got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place."	"twain"
"Why, how you talkSheffield ain't on the sea."	"twain"
"Every minute it was getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir, and I might get catchedcatched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of."	"twain"
"No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that."	"twain"
"It warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that."	"twain"
"But that trick took 'em to the graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the excited fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we'd a slept in our cravats to-nightcravats warranted to wear, toolonger than we'd need 'em."	"twain"

"Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see?"	"twain"
"Why, they've stole everything they could lay their hands onand we a-watching all the time, mind you."	"twain"
"But of course I forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip."	"twain"
"Well, it always is when it's done right."	"twain"
"Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a pretty square day's work for it."	"twain"
"But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way."	"twain"

"Nine logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell."	"twain"

"I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger; but stead of that I will baa like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure."	"twain"
"Well, what did come of it, Jim?"	"twain"

"Look at both, pleasethey're by the same hand."	"twain"

"We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it was high ground, so I didn't go."	"twain"
"We boomed along down the river, watching for lights and watching for our raft."	"twain"
"But I said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he started."	"twain"

"twain"
"In the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns, Breathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i' the adage, Is sicklied o'er with care."

"I ranged up and says: Mister, is that town Cairo?"	"twain"
"So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn't go back on her promise."	"twain"

"he asked, holding one out to us."	"doyle"

"* * * It was nearly six o'clock before we found ourselves in the pretty Surrey village of Esher, with Inspector Baynes as our companion."	"doyle"
"Has he any one outstanding quality?"	"doyle"
"I'm sure it must look very bad, Mr. Holmes, and I am not aware that in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before."	"doyle"
"So I had my key to the secrets of the establishment."	"doyle"
"As impassive as ever to the casual observer, there were none the less a subdued eagerness and suggestion of tension in his brightened eyes and brisker manner which assured me that the game was afoot."	"doyle"
"You will show these gentlemen out, Mrs. Hudson, and kindly send the boy with this telegram."	"doyle"
"But here, unless I am mistaken, is our client."	"doyle"
"At first, as I examined it, I thought that it was a mummified negro baby, and then it seemed a very twisted and ancient monkey."	"doyle"
"Shall I read it, Mr. Gregson?"	"doyle"
"These two men, close and confidential friends, are the centre of the household; but there is one other person who for our immediate purpose may be even more important."	"doyle"
"Well, what is the next step?"	"doyle"
"They were all confederates in the same unknown crime."	"doyle"
"That, at least, is very easily settled, said Holmes, lighting his little pocket lantern."	"doyle"
"What was at the window, and when?"	"doyle"
"By the way, Mr. Baynes, did you find anything remarkable besides this note in your examination of the house?"	"doyle"
"Henderson he called himself, but I traced him back, Paris and Rome and Madrid to Barcelona, where his ship came in in '86."	"doyle"
"Or, again, there was that most grotesque affair of the five orange pips, which led straight to a murderous conspiracy."	"doyle"
"It was about five o'clock, and the shadows of the March evening were beginning to fall, when an excited rustic rushed into our room."	"doyle"
"Yes, he reported, after a short examination of the grass bed, a number twelve shoe, I should say."	"doyle"
"Yes, sir, my own views are very different."	"doyle"
"We have been following you about all the morning."	"doyle"
"I have already shown you that it could only lie in some large house, and that the number of large houses is limited."	"doyle"
"That is clearly a signal."	"doyle"
"The dinner itself was neither well served nor well cooked, and the gloomy presence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven us."	"doyle"
"What do you make of it?"	"doyle"
"Inspector Baynes visited us at Baker Street with a printed description of the dark face of the secretary, and of the masterful features, the magnetic black eyes, and the tufted brows of his master."	"doyle"
"The country detective chuckled."	"doyle"
"You must have examined the house very carefully to find a single pellet of paper."	"doyle"
"She was drugged with opium."	"doyle"
"Suddenly he turned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes."	"doyle"
"Then I ran from room to room."	"doyle"
"He is a man of fifty, strong, active, with iron-gray hair, great bunched black eyebrows, the step of a deer and the air of an emperora fierce, masterful man, with a red-hot spirit behind his parchment face."	"doyle"
"Or is she merely a prisoner?"	"doyle"
"Mr. Scott Eccles had fidgeted in his seat during this conversation."	"doyle"
"With a slow smile he drew a folded and discoloured scrap of paper from his pocket."	"doyle"
"Now, thank God, I am beyond their power forever."	"doyle"
"Telegraphic inquiries had been already made which showed that Marx knew nothing of his customer save that he was a good payer."	"doyle"
"We can't arrest without her evidence, that is clear, so the sooner we get a statement the better."	"doyle"
"You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your theories."	"doyle"
"They had him alone at their mercy every other night in the week."	"doyle"
"There's no link between the two save for Henderson's own servant, who serves the family's meals."	"doyle"
"We will go back to the note which was handed in to Garcia upon the evening of his death."	"doyle"
"So much I learned partly from village gossip and partly from my own observation."	"doyle"
"Then from the table he took a platter heaped with small pieces of charred bone."	"doyle"
"I drove to the placeabout two miles on the south side of Esher."	"doyle"
"We could not doubt that justice, if belated, had come at last."	"doyle"
"I tell you, sir, I couldn't move a finger, nor get my breath, till it whisked away and was gone."	"doyle"
"Lord, sir, what a face it was!"	"doyle"
"It was so wrinkled and shrunken and withered that it was difficult to say what it might have been."	"doyle"
"Did you chance to observe what became of it?"	"doyle"
"It was an old, tumbledown building in a crazy state of disrepair."	"doyle"
"I can assure you that many times in the course of the evening I wished that I could invent some excuse which would take me back to Lee."	"doyle"
"Then there was the size of itit was twice yours, sir."	"doyle"
"I am a bachelor, said he, and being of a sociable turn I cultivate a large number of friends."	"doyle"
"I think, Watson, a brandy and soda would do him no harm."	"doyle"
"Well, now, Watson, let us judge the situation by this new information."	"doyle"
"I'll knock at the window."	"doyle"
"The dictator, his two children, his secretary, and his wealth had all escaped them."	"doyle"
"This afternoon a good lunch was brought me, but the moment after I took it I knew that I had been drugged."	"doyle"
"The whole inexplicable tangle seemed to straighten out before me."	"doyle"
"It was a gloomy, high-ceilinged room at the back of the house, with a straw litter in one corner, which served apparently as a bed for the cook."	"doyle"
"There is, on the face of it, something unnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young Spaniard and Scott Eccles."	"doyle"
"The man walked into the trap and was captured last night after a struggle in which Constable Downing was badly bitten by the savage."	"doyle"
"The Tiger of San Pedro!"	"doyle"
"I spent a morning in the British Museum reading up on that and other points."	"doyle"
"What do you say to that, Mr. Baynes?"	"doyle"
"That is certainly a possible point of view."	"doyle"
"The more usual victims are a white cock, which is plucked in pieces alive, or a black goat, whose throat is cut and body burned.'"	"doyle"
"It was a most furious assault."	"doyle"
"If he was all on the same scale as his foot he must certainly have been a giant."	"doyle"
"Your telegram was dispatched about one."	"doyle"
"Well, as he says, we must each try our own way and see what comes of it."	"doyle"
"He gave up all pretence at conversation and sat, smoking endless cigarettes, lost in his own thoughts, but he made no remark as to the contents."	"doyle"
"Yes, Baynes, I've seen it."	"doyle"
"He tossed it across with a laugh."	"doyle"
"I was to see that the doors were open and the signal of a green or white light in a window which faced the drive was to give notice if all was safe or if the attempt had better be postponed."	"doyle"
"This man has been seen since the crime, for he was detected and pursued by Constable Walters on the same evening, when he had the audacity to revisit Wisteria Lodge."	"doyle"
"There may be a hundred crimes in the background, but it is only on this one that they can be tried."	"doyle"
"It is a lonely corner, and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of the spot."	"doyle"
"And you think you have evidence that he murdered his late master?"	"doyle"
"For the rest, his house is full of butlers, footmen, maidservants, and the usual overfed, underworked staff of a large English country house."	"doyle"
"All would come round to me in due time."	"doyle"
"We sat for some time in silence after our visitors had left."	"doyle"
"Finally, after much debate, they concluded that my murder was too dangerous."	"doyle"
"We hurried down the village street and found, as we had expected, that the inspector was just leaving his lodgings."	"doyle"
"At first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to kill him as a detected burglar; but they argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open to further attacks."	"doyle"
"There are gaps in that direction which we have still to fill."	"doyle"
"Our visitor had gulped off the brandy and the colour had returned to his face."	"doyle"
"The detective looked at my friend in a singular way."	"doyle"
"You're welcome always to my news."	"doyle"
"And yet she may at the present moment be in danger of her life."	"doyle"
"Here they are in this telegram, and the other end of our tangled skein must lie among them."	"doyle"
"The oval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleeve-linkwhat else is of such a shape?"	"doyle"
"From under the sink he drew a zinc pail which contained a quantity of blood."	"doyle"
"In extreme cases these rites take the form of human sacrifices followed by cannibalism."	"doyle"
"But there's something in Inspector Baynes which I can't quite understand."	"doyle"
"We had a doctor in this morning."	"doyle"
"It was someone within the citadel, and it was a woman."	"doyle"
"But another will come, and yet another, until some day justice will be done; that is as certain as the rise of to-morrow's sun."	"doyle"
"We agreed to work on our own lines, Mr. Holmes."	"doyle"
"It is very pleasant to see the first green shoots upon the hedges and the catkins on the hazels once again."	"doyle"
"Our dinner was tete-a-tete, and though my host did his best to be entertaining, his thoughts seemed to continually wander, and he talked so vaguely and wildly that I could hardly understand him."	"doyle"
"He waited three days longer, and then his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more."	"doyle"
"What do you make of these bones?"	"doyle"
"If it were one which would also admit of the mysterious note with its very curious phraseology, why, then it would be worth accepting as a temporary hypothesis."	"doyle"
"In silence Baynes led the way to the sink and held forward his candle."	"doyle"
"If the fresh facts which come to our knowledge all fit themselves into the scheme, then our hypothesis may gradually become a solution."	"doyle"
"A plausible lawyer could make it out as an act of self-defence."	"doyle"
"Then came the downfall of the tyrant."	"doyle"
"He opened the door himself, however, and greeted me with a great show of cordiality."	"doyle"
"Scott Eccles, Post Office, Charing Cross."	"doyle"
"Through the fogged glass I dimly saw a man spring up from a chair beside the fire, and heard a sharp cry from within the room."	"doyle"
"You're very kind, Mr. Holmes."	"doyle"
"My first idea was that I had been the victim of some absurd practical joke."	"doyle"
"Here was this irreproachable Englishman ready to swear in any court of law that the accused was in the house all the time."	"doyle"
"My mind is like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was built."	"doyle"
"Apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing with them, and all the furniture down to the smallest details had been taken over with the house."	"doyle"
"Pray don't think it a liberty if I give you a word of friendly warning."	"doyle"
"When his companion and he had fled to some prearranged retreatalready occupied, no doubt by a confederatethe companion had persuaded him to leave so compromising an article of furniture."	"doyle"
"Apparently, said I as I read the following report: Great excitement was caused in Esher and the neighbouring district when it was learned late last night that an arrest had been effected in connection with the Oxshott murder."	"doyle"
"We may take it that the letter came out of this strange household and was an invitation to Garcia to carry out some attempt which had already been planned."	"doyle"
"With a premonition of his fate he had refused to take me with him."	"doyle"
"There was no response."	"doyle"
"As to Garcia, said Gregson, that is easily answered."	"doyle"
"I say 'criminal' because only a man with a criminal enterprise desires to establish an alibi."	"doyle"
"I see, he might have proved an alibi."	"doyle"
"Then when you tapped at the window I thought it had come again."	"doyle"
"I concentrated my attention, therefore, upon him and his household."	"doyle"
"I clasped his hand in silence, and the die was cast."	"doyle"
"You can imagine my surprise when I found that there was no one there."	"doyle"
"If he met it in some nefarious enterprise her lips might be sealed."	"doyle"
"Our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional appearance."	"doyle"
"He and his master dragged me to my room and held judgment upon me as a convicted traitress."	"doyle"
"My results are always very much at your service if you care to apply to me for them."	"doyle"
"This fellow is a perfect savage, as strong as a cart-horse and as fierce as the devil."	"doyle"
"Please arrange your thoughts and let me know, in their due sequence, exactly what those events are which have sent you out unbrushed and unkempt, with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry, in search of advice and assistance."	"doyle"
"Finally I was left in doubt as to whether it was animal or human."	"doyle"
"* * * An answer had arrived to Holmes's telegram before our Surrey officer had returned."	"doyle"
"I can't make the man out."	"doyle"
"When I woke it was broad daylight."	"doyle"
"He had been there since one o'clock."	"doyle"
"You have a theory then?"	"doyle"
"He had described his household to me before I went there."	"doyle"
"Nothing in all this, said Baynes, stalking, candle in hand, from room to room."	"doyle"
"Did his companions follow him and kill him?"	"doyle"
"It is accessible from the top of an outhouse."	"doyle"
"Exactly, my dear Watson; he might have proved an alibi."	"doyle"
"Curious, Mr. Baynes, very curious."	"doyle"
"They banded themselves into a society which should never be dissolved until the work was done."	"doyle"
"I went to the house agents, you know, and they said that Mr. Garcia's rent was paid up all right and that everything was in order at Wisteria Lodge."	"doyle"
"Perhaps when I have finished at the police-station you would care to come out and give me your opinion of them."	"doyle"
"We stagnate in the provinces."	"doyle"
"Joshua Stone, Nether Walsling."	"doyle"
"Why, Mr. Holmes, when you were crawling in the shrubbery at High Gable I was up one of the trees in the plantation and saw you down below."	"doyle"
"How can an English lady join in such a murderous affair?"	"doyle"
"It is a quarter-past two, he said."	"doyle"
"But everything went wrong with us."	"doyle"
"So you see our savage friend was very orthodox in his ritual."	"doyle"
"But how about the disappearance of the others?"	"doyle"
"Do you follow your path and I will follow mine."	"doyle"
"He continually drummed his fingers on the table, gnawed his nails, and gave other signs of nervous impatience."	"doyle"
"Henderson, the inspector answered, is Don Murillo, once called the Tiger of San Pedro."	"doyle"
"Lopez addressed the note which I had written, sealed it with his sleeve-link, and sent it by the hand of the servant, Jose."	"doyle"
"Henderson has two childrengirls of eleven and thirteen."	"doyle"
"My host had shown me which was his bedroom the night before, so I knocked at the door."	"doyle"
"One house, and only one, riveted my attention."	"doyle"

"But there was something in the ice-cold reasoning of Holmes which made it impossible to shrink from any adventure which he might recommend."	"doyle"

"Why, sir, you've got me the very evidence I want, said the inspector warmly, shaking my friend by the hand."	"doyle"
"He escaped as you have just described."	"doyle"
"We had all listened intently to this remarkable statement."	"doyle"
"They've been looking for him all the time for their revenge, but it is only now that they have begun to find him out."	"doyle"
"But I beg to point out that I have not yet heard what has happened to Mr. Garcia, nor what has become of his household."	"doyle"

"I'm sure, Watson, a week in the country will be invaluable to you, he remarked."	"doyle"
"The woman's disappearance counts for nothing, since in that extraordinary household any member of it might be invisible for a week."	"doyle"
"And now I come to the amazing part of my tale."	"doyle"

"Some time later Garcia looked in at my doorthe room was dark at the timeand asked me if I had rung."	"doyle"
"How do I come to be mixed up with the case?"	"doyle"
"It is equally certain that this house cannot be more than a mile or two from Oxshott, since Garcia was walking in that direction and hoped, according to my reading of the facts, to be back in Wisteria Lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi, which would only be valid up to one o'clock."	"doyle"
"With a spud, a tin box, and an elementary book on botany, there are instructive days to be spent."	"doyle"

"Holmes and I had taken things for the night, and found comfortable quarters at the Bull."	"doyle"
"Main stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize."	"doyle"
"The crime was ascribed to Nihilism, and the murderers were never arrested."	"doyle"
"The proof of this lies in the fact that it was he who had arranged for the presence of Scott Eccles, which could only have been done for the purpose of an alibi."	"doyle"
"You are like my friend, Dr. Watson, who has a bad habit of telling his stories wrong end foremost."	"doyle"
"That's what I am doing."	"doyle"
"May I ask, sir, what you did then?"	"doyle"

"And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight, O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep, Then dreams, he of another benefice: Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again."

"Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!"	"shakespeare"

"shakespeare"
"Even so lies she, Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering."	"shakespeare"
"Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it; That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet."	"shakespeare"

"God shall mend my soul!"	"shakespeare"
"Nurse Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower."	"shakespeare"
"Alla stoccata carries it away."	"shakespeare"
"Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, Alike betwitched by the charm of looks, But to his foe supposed he must complain, And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks: Being held a foe, he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear; And she as much in love, her means much less To meet her new-beloved any where: But passion lends them power, time means, to meet Tempering extremities with extreme sweet."

"TYBALT Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting."	"shakespeare"
"FRIAR LAURENCE Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company: I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom."	"shakespeare"
"ROMEO As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun, Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand Murder'd her kinsman."	"shakespeare"
"Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, I think it best you married with the county."	"shakespeare"
"My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?"	"shakespeare"
"And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone; A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly: 'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?"	"shakespeare"
"This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell."	"shakespeare"
"JULIET Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss."	"shakespeare"
"My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain; And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband: All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?"	"shakespeare"
"Have you deliver'd to her our decree?"	"shakespeare"
"O any thing, of nothing first create!"	"shakespeare"
"Had she affections and warm youthful blood, She would be as swift in motion as a ball; My words would bandy her to my sweet love, And his to me: But old folks, many feign as they were dead; Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead."	"shakespeare"
"PARIS Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report."	"shakespeare"
"A room in Capulet's house."	"shakespeare"
"And stay thy lady too that lives in thee, By doing damned hate upon thyself?"	"shakespeare"
"FRIAR LAURENCE Go with me to the vault."	"shakespeare"
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars, As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night."	"shakespeare"
"he was not born to shame: Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit; For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd Sole monarch of the universal earth."	"shakespeare"
"Do you not see that I am out of breath?"	"shakespeare"
"Or, if I live, is it not very like, The horrible conceit of death and night, Together with the terror of the place, As in a vault, an ancient receptacle, Where, for these many hundred years, the bones Of all my buried ancestors are packed: Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say, At some hours in the night spirits resort; Alack, alack, is it not like that I, So early waking, what with loathsome smells, And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth, That living mortals, hearing them, run mad: O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught, Environed with all these hideous fears?"	"shakespeare"
"Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh."	"shakespeare"
"MERCUTIO More than prince of cats, I can tell you."	"shakespeare"

"ROMEO She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, For beauty starved with her severity Cuts beauty off from all posterity."	"shakespeare"
"O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully: Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won, I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay, So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world."	"shakespeare"
"Nurse Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife: Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks, They'll be in scarlet straight at any news."	"shakespeare"
"I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday, Or never after look me in the face: Speak not, reply not, do not answer me; My fingers itch."	"shakespeare"
"Enter Nurse Nurse Mistress!"	"shakespeare"
"CAPULET And why, my lady wisdom?"	"shakespeare"
"Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?"	"shakespeare"
"Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun: didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter?"	"shakespeare"
"LADY CAPULET Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy, That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for."	"shakespeare"
"CAPULET Well, he may chance to do some good on her: A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is."	"shakespeare"
"Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!"	"shakespeare"
"LADY CAPULET The people in the street cry Romeo, Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run, With open outcry toward our monument."	"shakespeare"

"Well, Wednesday is too soon, O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her, She shall be married to this noble earl."	"shakespeare"
"Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket FRIAR LAURENCE The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels: Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, I must up-fill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers."

"ROMEO Is she a Capulet?"	"shakespeare"
"PRINCE A glooming peace this morning with it brings; The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head: Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished: For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."	"shakespeare"

"All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation."	"austen"
"Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but said nothing."	"austen"
"He promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent."	"austen"
"Yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was over."	"austen"
"But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle."	"austen"
"You have delighted us long enough."	"austen"
"To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated."	"austen"
"It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it."	"austen"
"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other."	"austen"
"I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder."	"austen"
"She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man."	"austen"
"How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?"	"austen"
"She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."	"austen"
"She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her."	"austen"
"The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life!"	"austen"
"The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia."	"austen"
"Wherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple ofor I may say, threevery silly sisters."	"austen"
"This was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something very like regret."	"austen"
"These are home questionsand perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature."	"austen"
"This is not to be borne."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was."	"austen"
"certainly, said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; we will ask you no questions."	"austen"
"Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity."	"austen"
"Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it."	"austen"
"Lydia laughed, and said: Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of."	"austen"
"But that is one great difference between us."	"austen"
"She had ventured only one glance at Darcy."	"austen"
"As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done."	"austen"
"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office."	"austen"
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!"	"austen"
"When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were."	"austen"
"Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more."	"austen"
"With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added: How long did you say he was at Rosings?"	"austen"
"As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too."	"austen"
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"	"austen"
"His disposition must be dreadful."	"austen"
"Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion."	"austen"
"He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us."	"austen"
"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."	"austen"
"You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage."	"austen"
"They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit."	"austen"
"That reply will do for the present."	"austen"
"The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages."	"austen"
"As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."	"austen"
"I know we dine with four-and-twenty families."	"austen"
"He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book."	"austen"
"The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts."	"austen"
"And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything."	"austen"
"They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain."	"austen"
"my dear, cried his wife, I cannot bear to hear that mentioned."	"austen"
"In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness."	"austen"
"Chapter 51 Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself."	"austen"
"She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage."	"austen"
"For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him."	"austen"
"DEAR SIR, I must trouble you once more for congratulations."	"austen"
"Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did."	"austen"
"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both, replied Jane; and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together."	"austen"
"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley, replied Jane, your representation of all this might make me quite easy."	"austen"
"At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."	"austen"
"She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it."	"austen"
"If it were merely a fine house richly furnished, said she, I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful."	"austen"
"You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness."	"austen"
"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother."	"austen"
"They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day."	"austen"
"They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself."	"austen"
"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often."	"austen"
"In a short time I shall have a daughter married."	"austen"
"My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham."	"austen"
"After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped."	"austen"
"In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on."	"austen"
"I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!"	"austen"
"Pray do not talk of that odious man."	"austen"
"As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table: This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of."	"austen"
"But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."	"austen"
"Chapter 55 A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone."	"austen"
"I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it."	"austen"
"Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them."	"austen"
"Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."	"austen"
"Into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance."	"austen"
"Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send."	"austen"
"He took the hint, and soon began with, This seems a very comfortable house."	"austen"
"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only."	"austen"
"Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be toldthe history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy."	"austen"
"He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you."	"austen"
"No, said Darcy, I have made no such pretension."	"austen"
"It was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of hers."	"austen"
"My uncle is to send a servant for us."	"austen"
"Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites."	"austen"
"I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former."	"austen"
"Yes, or I will never see her again."	"austen"
"Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings."	"austen"
"Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman."	"austen"
"This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving."	"austen"
"cried his wife impatiently."	"austen"
"Chapter 11 When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared."	"austen"
"About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement."	"austen"
"She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead!"	"austen"
"Well, he is a very undeserving young manand I do not suppose there's the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now."	"austen"
"Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere."	"austen"
"Jane looked at her doubtingly."	"austen"
"But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's."	"austen"
"But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly."	"austen"
"His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear: I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball."	"austen"
"He did not talk to me of his own arts, said Fitzwilliam, smiling."	"austen"
"The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood."	"austen"
"My object then, replied Darcy, was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to."	"austen"
"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?"	"austen"
"Have you heard from my uncle?"	"austen"
"Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!)"	"austen"
"The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered."	"austen"
"Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet."	"austen"
"Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time."	"austen"
"And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?"	"austen"
"In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned."	"austen"
"How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!"	"austen"
"And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister?"	"austen"
"But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent."	"austen"
"Society, I own, is necessary to me."	"austen"
"Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair."	"austen"
"The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited."	"austen"
"exclaimed Elizabeth, you are too good."	"austen"
"At present I will say nothing about it."	"austen"
"Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world."	"austen"
"In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?"	"austen"
"Come, Darcy, said he, I must have you dance."	"austen"
"She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham."	"austen"
"And I have another favour to ask you."	"austen"
"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley."	"austen"
"and yet how many things have happened!"	"austen"
"On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time."	"austen"
"About a month, said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand."	"austen"
"Your idea of the ponies is delightful."	"austen"
"As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered: I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family."	"austen"
"how would she have behaved?"	"austen"
"Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister."	"austen"
"She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting."	"austen"
"They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses."	"austen"
"My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance."	"austen"
"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do."	"austen"
"The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand."	"austen"
"When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject."	"austen"
"That is capital, added her sister, and they both laughed heartily."	"austen"
"She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation."	"austen"
"I should like it beyond anything!"	"austen"
"I cannot quite agree with you there."	"austen"
"I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes."	"austen"
"With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand."	"austen"
"It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view."	"austen"
"At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration."	"austen"
"Heaven and earth!of what are you thinking?"	"austen"
"Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do."	"austen"
"On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband."	"austen"
"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine."	"austen"
"He replied, and was again silent."	"austen"
"On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn."	"austen"
"The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense."	"austen"
"Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars."	"austen"
"Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached."	"austen"
"Can I have the carriage?"	"austen"
"About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged."	"austen"
"But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy is all politeness, said Elizabeth, smiling."	"austen"
"And then when we came away it was such fun!"	"austen"
"But with me, it is not so."	"austen"
"My mind was more agreeably engaged."	"austen"
"It is nearly fifty miles."	"austen"
"My aunt told me so herself on Saturday."	"austen"
"It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor."	"austen"
"I dearly love a laugh."	"austen"
"My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect."	"austen"
"Elizabeth's courage did not fail her."	"austen"
"Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."	"austen"
"Give me further particulars."	"austen"
"From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day."	"austen"
"Everything wore a happier aspect."	"austen"
"As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go."	"austen"
"Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder."	"austen"
"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!"	"austen"
"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed, added Charlotte, and a most attentive neighbour."	"austen"
"He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy."	"austen"
"I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not."	"austen"
"And have you heard from him often?"	"austen"
"He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump."	"austen"
"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed."	"austen"
"Lydia was exceedingly fond of him."	"austen"
"He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her; and, before she could reply, he added, It is above eight months."	"austen"
"Of what are you talking?"	"austen"
"Let me hear from you very soon."	"austen"
"I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society."	"austen"
"Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."	"austen"
"If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go."	"austen"
"We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing."	"austen"
"When I wrote that letter, replied Darcy, I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."	"austen"
"How he lived I know not."	"austen"
"Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."	"austen"
"My dear aunt, how could you think of it?"	"austen"
"And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road."	"austen"
"I came to you without a doubt of my reception."	"austen"
"And one of my own daughters."	"austen"
"She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom."	"austen"
"You mistake me, my dear."	"austen"
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know; said her mother, as soon as she was in the hall."	"austen"
"Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?"	"austen"
"I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me."	"austen"
"Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything."	"austen"
"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."	"austen"
"We can all begin freelya slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement."	"austen"
"The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity."	"austen"
"But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design."	"austen"
"To yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you."	"austen"
"Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence."	"austen"
"Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham."	"austen"
"What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?"	"austen"
"She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself."	"austen"
"But you are always giving her the preference."	"austen"
"Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."	"austen"
"I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music."	"austen"
"In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go."	"austen"
"He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over."	"austen"
"This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent."	"austen"
"It was to be such a secret!"	"austen"
"She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on."	"austen"
"I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected."	"austen"
"My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it."	"austen"
"They are gone off together from Brighton."	"austen"
"Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away."	"austen"
"It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's."	"austen"
"Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire."	"austen"
"She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together."	"austen"
"Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase."	"austen"
"Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them."	"austen"
"You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas."	"austen"
"I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."	"austen"
"Then addressing her daughter, Oh!"	"austen"
"Chapter 46 Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere."	"austen"
"You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created."	"austen"
"That lady, I suppose, is your mother."	"austen"
"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men."	"austen"
"The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome."	"austen"
"Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life."	"austen"
"Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling."	"austen"
"Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear."	"austen"
"I am not now to learn, replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time."	"austen"
"This is a parade, he cried, which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune!"	"austen"
"I desire you to stay where you are."	"austen"
"Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves."	"austen"
"of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!"	"austen"
"Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield."	"austen"
"In what an amiable light does this place him!"	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man!"	"austen"
"But why all this secrecy?"	"austen"
"why is not everybody as happy?"	"austen"
"Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense."	"austen"
"Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly."	"austen"
"You mentioned two instances."	"austen"
"At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance."	"austen"
"There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know."	"austen"
"Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party."	"austen"
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?"	"austen"
"She is almost three-and-twenty!"	"austen"
"Chapter 43 Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter."	"austen"
"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!"	"austen"
"Both sisters were uncomfortable enough."	"austen"
"What do I not owe you!"	"austen"
"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either."	"austen"
"In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage."	"austen"
"Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton."	"austen"
"If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better."	"austen"
"Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on."	"austen"
"Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"	"austen"
"When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel."	"austen"
"Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy."	"austen"
"I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that."	"austen"
"I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place."	"austen"
"Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it."	"austen"
"Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her."	"austen"
"I dislike it very much, he replied; but it must be done."	"austen"
"My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?"	"austen"
"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?"	"austen"
"How should you have liked making sermons?"	"austen"
"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy."	"austen"
"Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little."	"austen"
"Lizzy, said he, what are you doing?"	"austen"
"She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial."	"austen"
"Elizabeth added privately, And how much I shall have to conceal!"	"austen"
"Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"	"austen"
"She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another."	"austen"
"And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time."	"austen"
"How could I be so silly as to wish it!"	"austen"
"And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her: When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character."	"austen"
"My fingers wait your orders."	"austen"
"Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them."	"austen"
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin."	"austen"
"If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."	"austen"
"The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune."	"austen"
"I have a high respect for your nerves."	"austen"
"I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs."	"austen"
"But you forget, mamma, said Elizabeth, that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."	"austen"
"Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present."	"austen"
"By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary."	"austen"
"Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth."	"austen"
"He has made me so happy, said she, one evening, by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!"	"austen"
"Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little."	"austen"
"Chapter 8 At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner."	"austen"
"What could she mean by it?"	"austen"
"yesI understand you perfectly."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance."	"austen"
"While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning."	"austen"
"Do you often dance at St. James's?"	"austen"
"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well."	"austen"
"But it is fortunate, thought she, that I have something to wish for."	"austen"
"The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person."	"austen"
"The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter."	"austen"
"No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortuneor that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent's mind."	"austen"
"NoI do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."	"austen"
"By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments."	"austen"
"I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match, cried Elizabeth."	"austen"
"Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest?"	"austen"
"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting."	"austen"
"She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you."	"austen"
"Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane."	"austen"
"Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush."	"austen"
"said she, I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply."	"austen"
"I do not believe she often sees such at home."	"austen"
"Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them."	"austen"
"You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you."	"austen"
"Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look and behaviour."	"austen"
"Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!)"	"austen"
"This cannot be!engaged to Mr. Darcy!"	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery."	"austen"
"That he should even speak to her was amazing!but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!"	"austen"
"Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all."	"austen"
"Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure."	"austen"
"He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was very glad; but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation."	"austen"
"The possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained."	"austen"
"We acted with the best intentions."	"austen"
"How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!"	"austen"
"And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room."	"austen"
"Come be quick, be quick!"	"austen"
"The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner."	"austen"
"It was all pride and insolence."	"austen"
"To this Mary very gravely replied, Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures!"	"austen"
"They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them."	"austen"
"And then, said she, if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself."	"austen"
"That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination."	"austen"
"I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."	"austen"
"Far be it from me, he presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure, to resent the behaviour of your daughter."	"austen"
"After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself."	"austen"
"She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance."	"austen"
"Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room."	"austen"
"Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject."	"austen"
"my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!"	"austen"
"When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel."	"austen"
"But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance."	"austen"
"You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone."	"austen"
"Chapter 26 Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly."	"austen"
"There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others."	"austen"
"They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of that they would have been glad to be certain."	"austen"
"A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudencein short anything or nothing."	"austen"
"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me."	"austen"
"If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence."	"austen"
"Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections."	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet replied that he had not."	"austen"
"Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration."	"austen"
"Darcy made no answer."	"austen"
"The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit."	"austen"
"Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away."	"austen"
"I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent."	"austen"
"As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them."	"austen"
"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs, said her father; she times them ill."	"austen"
"It is highly improper."	"austen"
"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"	"austen"
"I rather wonder now at your knowing any."	"austen"
"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself."	"austen"
"Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits."	"austen"
"Lydiathe humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern."	"austen"
"A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation."	"austen"
"Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?"	"austen"
"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two."	"austen"
"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it."	"austen"
"But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then."	"austen"
"On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer."	"austen"
"And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident."	"austen"
"I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him."	"austen"
"I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after."	"austen"
"She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness."	"austen"
"If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one."	"austen"
"But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, Is it in address that he improves?"	"austen"
"Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning."	"austen"
"Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!"	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding."	"austen"
"Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"	"austen"
"We can all plague and punish one another."	"austen"
"I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable."	"austen"
"His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything."	"austen"
"said Elizabeth to herself."	"austen"
"The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse."	"austen"
"Lizzy, cried her mother, remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."	"austen"
"What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err."	"austen"
"I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy."	"austen"
"They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better."	"austen"
"She finds Miss Pope a treasure."	"austen"
"If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry."	"austen"
"* * * * * Good gracious!"	"austen"
"When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing."	"austen"
"I shall see her again!"	"austen"
"Another time, Lizzy, said her mother, I would not dance with him, if I were you."	"austen"
"Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her."	"austen"
"Perhaps I am not doing her justice."	"austen"
"I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."	"austen"
"I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."	"austen"
"It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection."	"austen"
"In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out: My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down."	"austen"
"Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody."	"austen"
"The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose."	"austen"
"I told you, the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him."	"austen"
"I wonder what he can be doing there."	"austen"
"But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonthshe has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity."	"austen"
"You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did."	"austen"
"Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly."	"austen"
"He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask."	"austen"
"I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away."	"austen"
"Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully."	"austen"
"I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard."	"austen"
"If I wished to think slightingly of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however."	"austen"
"The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation."	"austen"
"Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together."	"austen"
"On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects."	"austen"
"Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder."	"austen"
"You will be a very happy woman."	"austen"
"I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier."	"austen"
"He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy: Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master."	"austen"
"But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."	"austen"
"So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."	"austen"
"I never saw such a woman."	"austen"
"But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."	"austen"
"Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed."	"austen"
"I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way."	"austen"
"The period of expectation was now doubled."	"austen"
"She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it."	"austen"
"He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again."	"austen"
"Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified."	"austen"
"Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learntfor her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public."	"austen"
"You have only proved by this, cried Elizabeth, that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition."	"austen"
"When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."	"austen"
"Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her."	"austen"
"But you have chosen your fault well."	"austen"
"Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence."	"austen"
"You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine."	"austen"
"It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity."	"austen"
"Kitty, run down and order the carriage."	"austen"
"He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend."	"austen"
"I was ready to die of laughter."	"austen"
"She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance."	"austen"
"Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women."	"austen"
"Not that I shall, though, she added to herself, as she finished the letter; and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."	"austen"
"What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state."	"austen"
"Yes, madam, said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner."	"austen"
"She has known him only a fortnight."	"austen"
"Yes, replied Mr. Wickham; his estate there is a noble one."	"austen"
"But vanity, not love, has been my folly."	"austen"
"I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday."	"austen"
"And Lydia used to want to go to London, added Kitty."	"austen"
"We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is."	"austen"
"There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care."	"austen"
"I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose."	"austen"
"What an excellent father you have, girls!"	"austen"
"Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name."	"austen"
"In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour."	"austen"
"You certainly do, she replied with a smile; but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."	"austen"
"But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps."	"austen"
"We must not all expect Jane's good fortune."	"austen"
"An easy distance, do you call it?"	"austen"
"They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration."	"austen"
"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear, said Mrs. Bennet, you will wait on him of course."	"austen"
"There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance."	"austen"
"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him."	"austen"
"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future."	"austen"
"I think you said she was a widow, sir?"	"austen"
"No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame."	"austen"
"Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can."	"austen"
"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?"	"austen"
"But it was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again."	"austen"
"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!"	"austen"
"who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!"	"austen"
"But Jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat Mr. Bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public."	"austen"
"Mamma, cried Lydia, my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."	"austen"
"Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them."	"austen"
"I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her."	"austen"
"She went on: From the very beginningfrom the first moment, I may almost sayof my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."	"austen"
"But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence."	"austen"
"I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown Here she was interrupted again."	"austen"
"Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her."	"austen"
"And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"	"austen"
"Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express."	"austen"
"I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted."	"austen"
"He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible."	"austen"
"I shall like it of all things."	"austen"
"and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now."	"austen"
"Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?"	"austen"
"On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided."	"austen"
"I can hardly write for laughing."	"austen"
"He was on one side of her mother."	"austen"
"But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family."	"austen"
"it is of no consequence."	"austen"
"Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression."	"austen"
"Jane heard them with horror."	"austen"
"She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her."	"austen"
"Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world."	"austen"
"She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closet up stairs."	"austen"
"As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room."	"austen"
"We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes, said her mother resentfully, since we are not to visit."	"austen"
"It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go."	"austen"
"I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town."	"austen"
"It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure."	"austen"
"Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings."	"austen"
"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself."	"austen"
"I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way."	"austen"
"Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure."	"austen"
"They will join me early to-morrow, he continued, and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with youMr."	"austen"
"I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield."	"austen"
"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion."	"austen"
"After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard."	"austen"
"A great many indeed, said her companion with a sigh."	"austen"
"﻿Chapter 1 It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."	"austen"
"They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds."	"austen"
"I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company."	"austen"
"Adieu to disappointment and spleen."	"austen"
"Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves."	"austen"
"Chapter 58 Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit."	"austen"
"And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, Oh!"	"austen"
"She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste."	"austen"
"Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man."	"austen"
"It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us."	"austen"
"And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had!"	"austen"
"Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante."	"austen"
"do not repeat what I then said."	"austen"
"It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."	"austen"
"Indeed, Mr. Bennet, said she, it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take her place in it!"	"austen"
"Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification."	"austen"
"Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"	"austen"
"I wish I could see her."	"austen"
"I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object."	"austen"
"What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."	"austen"
"Elizabeth could not but look surprised."	"austen"
"Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned."	"austen"
"Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object; she could think only of her letter."	"austen"
"There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects."	"austen"
"If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?"	"austen"
"Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes."	"austen"
"I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance."	"austen"
"Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red."	"austen"
"But consider your daughters."	"austen"
"To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again."	"austen"
"I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind."	"austen"
"We now come to the point."	"austen"
"He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one."	"austen"
"No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room."	"austen"
"Chapter 56 One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn."	"austen"
"The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles."	"austen"
"After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thoughtre-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation."	"austen"
"Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintancean acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his waysseen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustanything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valuedthat even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible."	"austen"
"The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres."	"austen"
"So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him!"	"austen"
"Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James's."	"austen"
"After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."	"austen"
"Yet, indeed, I am in earnest."	"austen"
"I had not thought so very ill of him."	"austen"
"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as thisthough I have never liked him."	"austen"
"You are a good girl; he replied, and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled."	"austen"
"If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed."	"austen"
"His surprise was great."	"austen"
"Miss Lucas is married and settled."	"austen"
"Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country."	"austen"
"Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement."	"austen"
"I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding."	"austen"
"I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united."	"austen"
"He immediately offered to fetch her othersall that his library afforded."	"austen"
"Who do you mean, my dear?"	"austen"
"In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: Oh!"	"austen"
"It is, I believe, too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world."	"austen"
"The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification."	"austen"
"But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."	"austen"
"On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer."	"austen"
"The express was sent off directly."	"austen"
"I thought we never should have got into the coach."	"austen"
"She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so."	"austen"
"When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence."	"austen"
"Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."	"austen"
"He is now gone into the army, she added; but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."	"austen"
"He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party."	"austen"
"Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough."	"austen"
"And men take care that they should."	"austen"
"Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other."	"austen"
"My father bears it better."	"austen"
"Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest."	"austen"
"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything will be well."	"austen"
"But perhaps, added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design."	"austen"
"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart."	"austen"
"I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything."	"austen"
"He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."	"austen"
"I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again."	"austen"
"Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowdbut of that I despair."	"austen"
"She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance."	"austen"
"How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!"	"austen"
"Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?"	"austen"
"Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps."	"austen"
"But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen."	"austen"
"I am confident that she would have performed delightfully."	"austen"
"and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too!"	"austen"
"Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy."	"austen"
"Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight."	"austen"
"The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely."	"austen"
"His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative."	"austen"
"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?"	"austen"
"Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both."	"austen"
"Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House."	"austen"
"Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard."	"austen"
"It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn."	"austen"
"They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meand, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.Yours, etc."	"austen"
"When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away."	"austen"
"I mend pens remarkably well."	"austen"
"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?"	"austen"
"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy, observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes."	"austen"
"I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help."	"austen"
"My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!"	"austen"
"Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime."	"austen"
"Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way."	"austen"
"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment."	"austen"
"Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me."	"austen"
"But pridewhere there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end."	"austen"
"She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself."	"austen"
"At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life."	"austen"
"The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted."	"austen"
"Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in."	"austen"
"And this, cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, is your opinion of me!"	"austen"
"She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family."	"austen"
"I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life."	"austen"
"You must not be too severe upon yourself, replied Elizabeth."	"austen"
"Oh, yes!if one could but go to Brighton!"	"austen"
"While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner."	"austen"
"The rector of a parish has much to do."	"austen"
"No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home."	"austen"
"Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot."	"austen"
"My dear, replied her husband, I have two small favours to request."	"austen"
"Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care."	"austen"
"But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?"	"austen"
"Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply."	"austen"
"Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival."	"austen"
"The supposition did not pain her."	"austen"
"She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added: My eldest sister has been in town these three months."	"austen"
"No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called."	"austen"
"I send no compliments to your mother."	"austen"
"What do you think has happened this morning?"	"austen"
"By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy."	"austen"
"Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent."	"austen"
"Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, What is the matter mamma?"	"austen"
"This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley."	"austen"
"She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's."	"austen"
"She directly replied: You need not be frightened."	"austen"
"Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here."	"austen"
"But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room."	"austen"
"Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion."	"austen"
"My dear Mr. Bennet, replied his wife, how can you be so tiresome!"	"austen"
"When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."	"austen"
"In spite of having been at St. James's Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter."	"austen"
"Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty!"	"austen"
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?"	"austen"
"Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home."	"austen"
"For God's sake, say no more of his partners."	"austen"
"He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals."	"austen"
"His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue."	"austen"
"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express themby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton."	"austen"
"But I dare not hope it."	"austen"
"Not that I care about it, though."	"austen"
"At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other."	"austen"
"But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."	"austen"
"I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished."	"austen"
"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances."	"austen"
"Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure."	"austen"
"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like himjust as affable to the poor."	"austen"
"I speak nothing but the truth."	"austen"
"Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious."	"austen"
"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged."	"austen"
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities, replied her uncle."	"austen"
"You can now have nothing further to say, she resentfully answered."	"austen"
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair, said Mr. Bennet, and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn."	"austen"
"We never had any governess."	"austen"
"You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it."	"austen"
"I know very well, madam, said he, that when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object."	"austen"
"It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her."	"austen"
"Other schemes, too, came into her head."	"austen"
"You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters."	"austen"
"As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!how much of good or evil must be done by him!"	"austen"
"I found, said he, as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."	"austen"
"I am always glad to get a young person well placed out."	"austen"
"The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away."	"austen"
"His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."	"austen"
"Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley."	"austen"
"He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!"	"austen"
"The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend."	"austen"
"I knew he would manage everything!"	"austen"
"I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."	"austen"
"Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others."	"austen"
"At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family."	"austen"
"Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure."	"austen"
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."	"austen"
"It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day."	"austen"
"It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom."	"austen"
"Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or anybody's reserve, can be answerable for the event."	"austen"
"Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish."	"austen"
"I like her appearance, said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas."	"austen"
"Not yet, replied Jane."	"austen"
"My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."	"austen"
"It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh."	"austen"
"I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth."	"austen"
"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?"	"austen"
"Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast."	"austen"
"They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long."	"austen"
"were questions with which she amused herself."	"austen"
"what has she to do with it?"	"austen"
"When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give."	"austen"
"In the next room is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him."	"austen"
"Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball."	"austen"
"Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior toYou shall try it some day."	"austen"
"Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening."	"austen"
"Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood."	"austen"
"He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business."	"austen"
"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6."	"austen"
"What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority."	"austen"
"I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves."	"austen"
"It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome."	"austen"
"One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it."	"austen"
"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room."	"austen"
"Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."	"austen"
"To be sure that did seem as if he admired herindeed I rather believe he didI heard something about itbut I hardly know whatsomething about Mr. Robinson."	"austen"
"Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education."	"austen"
"But think no more of the letter."	"austen"
"But I tell you, Miss Lizzyif you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at alland I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead."	"austen"
"You deserve no such attention."	"austen"
"Such very superior dancing is not often seen."	"austen"
"We accordingly wentand there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice."	"austen"
"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family."	"austen"
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single."	"austen"
"You doubt me, cried Jane, slightly colouring; indeed, you have no reason."	"austen"
"Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her mother's apartment, immediately met her."	"austen"
"I have not a doubt of your doing very well together."	"austen"
"The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance."	"austen"
"Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added: She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker."	"austen"
"In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over."	"austen"
"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what."	"austen"
"Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon."	"austen"
"She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange."	"austen"
"She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper."	"austen"
"Only think of its being three months, she cried, since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time."	"austen"
"He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend."	"austen"
"She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house."	"austen"
"added Elizabeth; safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."	"austen"
"Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard."	"austen"
"Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him."	"austen"
"Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him."	"austen"
"When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed."	"austen"
"susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough."	"austen"
"It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living."	"austen"
"Stay, stay, I will go myself."	"austen"
"I will make no promise of the kind."	"austen"
"What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy?"	"austen"
"It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning."	"austen"
"Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home."	"austen"
"Chapter 14 During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness."	"austen"
"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill. That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline, cried her brother, because he does not write with ease."	"austen"
"Yes, she will do for him very well."	"austen"
"It was to this effect: Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all well."	"austen"
"Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret."	"austen"
"He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all."	"austen"
"And of this place, thought she, I might have been mistress!"	"austen"
"On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all."	"austen"
"Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her."	"austen"
"To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others."	"austen"
"Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room."	"austen"
"Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment."	"austen"
"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event."	"austen"
"In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme."	"austen"
"Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that she would not give in to it."	"austen"
"At that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion."	"austen"
"Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination."	"austen"
"You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."	"austen"
"to put me on my guard?"	"austen"
"His belief of her sister's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice."	"austen"
"This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before."	"austen"
"My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better."	"austen"
"In every view it is unaccountable!"	"austen"
"But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you."	"austen"
"But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early."	"austen"
"I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.'"	"austen"
"Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention."	"austen"
"Yes, thought Elizabeth, that would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once."	"austen"
"He could not speak a word for full ten minutes."	"austen"
"Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is."	"austen"
"you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general."	"austen"
"With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!"	"austen"
"Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence."	"austen"
"It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her."	"austen"
"We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."	"austen"
"They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests."	"austen"
"Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield."	"austen"
"Yes, sir; but I do not know when that will be."	"austen"
"Elizabeth coloured, and said: A little."	"austen"
"I never heard of such a thing."	"austen"
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?"	"austen"
"Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.'"	"austen"
"He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it."	"austen"
"Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer."	"austen"
"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think."	"austen"
"I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together."	"austen"
"Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it."	"austen"
"As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents."	"austen"
"Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay."	"austen"
"Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys."	"austen"
"I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with."	"austen"
"A man who had felt less, might."	"austen"
"But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day."	"austen"
"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country."	"austen"
"His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal."	"austen"
"Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room."	"austen"
"The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak."	"austen"
"There is something a little stately in him, to be sure, replied her aunt, but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming."	"austen"
"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means."	"austen"
"Let me be rightly understood."	"austen"
"You are severe on us."	"austen"
"Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth: MY DEAREST LIZZY, I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday."	"austen"
"Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?"	"austen"
"I will go to Meryton, said she, as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips."	"austen"
"Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth."	"austen"
"I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world."	"austen"
"To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it."	"austen"
"How was that possible?"	"austen"
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into."	"austen"
"But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name."	"austen"
"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."	"austen"
"His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown."	"austen"
"said he, as he joined her."	"austen"
"Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself."	"austen"
"Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away."	"austen"
"how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner."	"austen"
"It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter."	"austen"
"His temptation is not adequate to the risk!"	"austen"
"But what is to be done about Pemberley?"	"austen"
"They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street."	"austen"
"How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!"	"austen"
"At length she spoke again."	"austen"
"But it must not, shall not be."	"austen"
"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor."	"austen"
"That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head."	"austen"
"He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it."	"austen"
"But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."	"austen"
"In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference."	"austen"
"I was never more annoyed!"	"austen"
"You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."	"austen"
"Human nature is so prone to fall into it!"	"austen"
"Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody."	"austen"
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY Chapter 36 If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents."	"austen"
"It would have suited me in every respect."	"austen"
"Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would."	"austen"
"I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well."	"austen"
"She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night."	"austen"
"I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning."	"austen"
"My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life."	"austen"
"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity, said Elizabeth warmly; but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only."	"austen"
"He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected."	"austen"
"And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting."	"austen"
"My style of writing is very different from yours."	"austen"
"At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready."	"austen"
"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."	"austen"
"In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise."	"austen"
"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being."	"austen"
"She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak."	"austen"
"I am, said he, with a firm voice."	"austen"
"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought, said Mrs. Bennet; and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly."	"austen"
"If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all."	"austen"
"Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her."	"austen"
"Things are settled so oddly."	"austen"
"The loo-table, however, did not appear."	"austen"
"By this time she is actually with them!"	"austen"
"Miss Bingley, said he, has given me more credit than can be."	"austen"
"And do you impute it to either of those?"	"austen"
"This is delightful indeed!"	"austen"
"She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice."	"austen"
"Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces."	"austen"
"On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"	"austen"
"And they are really to be married!"	"austen"
"They had long wished to see him."	"austen"
"The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object."	"austen"
"Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head."	"austen"
"With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield."	"austen"
"It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?poor Eliza!to be only just tolerable."	"austen"
"Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made."	"austen"
"She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal."	"austen"
"Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance."	"austen"
"Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family."	"austen"
"His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother."	"austen"
"His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion."	"austen"
"But so they always are."	"austen"
"Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!"	"austen"
"It will save me a world of trouble and economy."	"austen"
"No, she would go home."	"austen"
"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made no answer."	"austen"
"This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him."	"austen"
"From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce."	"austen"
"She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself."	"austen"
"Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day."	"austen"
"She was ashamed to think how much."	"austen"
"The next was in these words: I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence."	"austen"
"They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited."	"austen"
"Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon."	"austen"
"His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else."	"austen"
"The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced."	"austen"
"Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night."	"austen"
"He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things."	"austen"
"He has not an ill-natured look."	"austen"
"Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else."	"austen"
"It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment."	"austen"
"Miss Bennet still looked all amazement."	"austen"
"If there were but such another man for you!"	"austen"
"Yet he is such a man!"	"austen"
"I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is."	"austen"
"The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he continued: My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdlywhich perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness."	"austen"
"That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate."	"austen"
"I always had a value for him."	"austen"
"Lizzy, said he, I was going to look for you; come into my room."	"austen"
"But no,recollecting herselfthat could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them."	"austen"
"The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth."	"austen"
"My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it."	"austen"
"But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable."	"austen"
"But papa is so disagreeable."	"austen"
"At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not."	"austen"
"She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her."	"austen"
"That is not an unnatural surmise, said Fitzwilliam, but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."	"austen"
"Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page."	"austen"
"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong, said she, and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment!"	"austen"
"But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real characterit adds even another motive."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted."	"austen"
"That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable."	"austen"
"She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out Oh, my dear Eliza!"	"austen"
"The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging."	"austen"
"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic."	"austen"
"They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride."	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered."	"austen"
"You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him."	"austen"
"And a special licence."	"austen"
"The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground."	"austen"
"Let us hope for better things."	"austen"
"Nay, said Elizabeth, this is not fair."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins, said she, speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."	"austen"
"I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner."	"austen"
"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more."	"austen"
"She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome."	"austen"
"At night she opened her heart to Jane."	"austen"
"It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts."	"austen"
"Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself."	"austen"
"The moral will be perfectly fair."	"austen"
"was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to table."	"austen"
"I am sure, she added, if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise."	"austen"
"It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account."	"austen"
"The wisest and the best of mennay, the wisest and best of their actionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke."	"austen"
"Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him."	"austen"
"I must beg to return to the house."	"austen"
"When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist."	"austen"
"They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!"	"austen"
"I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh."	"austen"
"Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry."	"austen"
"Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself."	"austen"
"He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant."	"austen"
"And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply."	"austen"
"She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way."	"austen"
"How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"	"austen"
"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."	"austen"
"We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating."	"austen"
"And is it really true?"	"austen"
"I shall see her in January."	"austen"
"The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light."	"austen"
"But we are all liable to error."	"austen"
"If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up."	"austen"
"After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any successno such people had been seen to pass through."	"austen"
"His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter."	"austen"
"Wickham passed all his youth there, you know."	"austen"
"I am glad he is gone."	"austen"
"Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball."	"austen"
"His doing so drew her notice."	"austen"
"What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening."	"austen"
"He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room."	"austen"
"The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on."	"austen"
"Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again."	"austen"
"They followed her into the dining-parlour."	"austen"
"It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town."	"austen"
"I have sent for you on an affair of importance."	"austen"
"My good opinion once lost, is lost forever."	"austen"
"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it."	"austen"
"Oh, no, nothis is not likely."	"austen"
"She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable."	"austen"
"She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise."	"austen"
"And this, said she, is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection!"	"austen"
"He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again."	"austen"
"Yes, I call it a very easy distance."	"austen"
"Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed."	"austen"
"She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation."	"austen"
"A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two."	"austen"
"They were excessively sorry to go!"	"austen"
"Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it."	"austen"
"It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."	"austen"
"I wish you had been there."	"austen"
"This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so."	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better."	"austen"
"Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.'"	"austen"
"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"	"austen"
"It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."	"austen"
"They have at least that advantage."	"austen"
"Their powers of conversation were considerable."	"austen"
"Perhaps, said Darcy, I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers."	"austen"
"There was no arguing upon such a project."	"austen"
"If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."	"austen"
"My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other."	"austen"
"Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's lifetime."	"austen"
"No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village."	"austen"
"She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more."	"austen"
"If one could but go to Brighton!"	"austen"
"But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you."	"austen"
"He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday."	"austen"
"On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away."	"austen"
"She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying: Is your sister at Pemberley still?"	"austen"
"Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover."	"austen"
"But who was your mother?"	"austen"
"As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"	"austen"
"This is wholly unexpected."	"austen"
"But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters."	"austen"
"She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave."	"austen"
"I did not think Caroline in spirits, were her words, but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London."	"austen"
"They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade."	"austen"
"She was wild to be at hometo hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe."	"austen"
"Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life."	"austen"
"To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment."	"austen"
"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."	"austen"
"But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness."	"austen"
"Something very much to the purpose of course."	"austen"
"Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it."	"austen"
"It keeps him in good humour, said she, and I am more obliged to you than I can express."	"austen"
"Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance."	"austen"
"She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more."	"austen"
"Tease himlaugh at him."	"austen"
"May I ask to what these questions tend?"	"austen"
"My dear father, I congratulate you."	"austen"
"Is this, thought Elizabeth, meant for me?"	"austen"
"I admire the activity of your benevolence, observed Mary, but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."	"austen"
"But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked."	"austen"
"Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante."	"austen"
"She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition."	"austen"
"Indeed I have, sir, was her answer."	"austen"
"All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry."	"austen"
"Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply."	"austen"
"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this."	"austen"
"And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you?"	"austen"
"Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?"	"austen"
"Put them next to your great-uncle the judge."	"austen"
"Shall you like to have such a brother?"	"austen"
"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side, said Jane."	"austen"
"He deserves to be publicly disgraced."	"austen"
"Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said: You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?"	"austen"
"I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."	"austen"
"Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject."	"austen"
"We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode."	"austen"
"I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."	"austen"
"She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings."	"austen"
"Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley."	"austen"
"Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first."	"austen"
"How much you must have gone through!"	"austen"
"Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!"	"austen"
"But are you pleased, Jane?"	"austen"
"My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart."	"austen"
"Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other."	"austen"
"Nothing could console and nothing could appease her."	"austen"
"But upon my honour, I do not."	"austen"
"My fingers, said Elizabeth, do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do."	"austen"
"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation, replied Elizabeth, but it is not in my power to accept it."	"austen"
"Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over."	"austen"
"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?"	"austen"
"Ayethat is because you have the right disposition."	"austen"
"The comfort to her of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression."	"austen"
"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved."	"austen"
"They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring."	"austen"
"She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress."	"austen"
"Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever."	"austen"
"if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better."	"austen"
"I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun."	"austen"
"I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?"	"austen"
"He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped."	"austen"
"I cannot make him out.There is something very pompous in his style.And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.Could he be a sensible man, sir?"	"austen"
"Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight."	"austen"
"He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country."	"austen"
"Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made."	"austen"
"Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense."	"austen"
"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could."	"austen"
"Miss Bennet, replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with."	"austen"
"You see on what a footing we are."	"austen"
"They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose."	"austen"
"He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been."	"austen"
"I told my sister Phillips so the other day."	"austen"
"And your defect is to hate everybody."	"austen"
"As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters."	"austen"
"We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."	"austen"
"My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last."	"austen"
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed!"	"austen"
"Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him."	"austen"
"But don't imagine it was from any silly cause."	"austen"
"Yet he knew to the contrary himself."	"austen"
"Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself."	"austen"
"His attachment to Rosings certainly increases."	"austen"
"It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain."	"austen"
"I quite detest the man."	"austen"
"You must not blame my aunt."	"austen"
"The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine."	"austen"
"* * * * * They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived."	"austen"
"The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent."	"austen"
"I appeal to Mr. Darcy:but let me not interrupt you, sir."	"austen"
"In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it."	"austen"
"Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress."	"austen"
"Well, my dear, said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessif she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders."	"austen"
"Have you seen any pleasant men?"	"austen"
"She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side."	"austen"
"It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage."	"austen"
"Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at church."	"austen"
"Do your sisters play and sing?"	"austen"
"Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility."	"austen"
"They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment."	"austen"
"With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed."	"austen"
"He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling."	"austen"
"And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long."	"austen"
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places."	"austen"
"But what is that to me?"	"austen"
"A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm."	"austen"
"Such a disappointment!"	"austen"
"It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the nextand, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do."	"austen"
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."	"austen"
"Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial."	"austen"
"If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."	"austen"
"Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit."	"austen"
"It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours."	"austen"
"To be sure, Lizzy, said her aunt, he is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good."	"austen"
"Did it, said he, did it soon make you think better of me?"	"austen"
"Ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to."	"austen"
"She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two."	"austen"
"They will have nothing else to do."	"austen"
"The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay."	"austen"
"Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem."	"austen"
"But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised."	"austen"
"said Miss Bingley; will she be as tall as I am?"	"austen"
"But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present."	"austen"
"He bore it, however, with admirable calmness."	"austen"
"Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day."	"austen"
"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family, said Elizabeth coolly, will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence."	"austen"
"There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him."	"austen"
"All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum."	"austen"
"Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them."	"austen"
"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."	"austen"
"The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies."	"austen"
"In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?"	"austen"
"I have no reason, I assure you, said he, to be dissatisfied with my reception."	"austen"
"But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together."	"austen"
"The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them."	"austen"
"Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same."	"austen"
"She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found."	"austen"
"What a contrast between him and his friend!"	"austen"
"Nor did that day wear out her resentment."	"austen"
"There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds."	"austen"
"I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth."	"austen"
"For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"	"austen"
"But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself."	"austen"
"said Jane as she finished it."	"austen"
"The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed."	"austen"
"Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten."	"austen"
"The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way."	"austen"
"the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question."	"austen"
"I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible."	"austen"
"But if we do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself."	"austen"
"But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation."	"austen"
"They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve."	"austen"
"There can be no doubt of that."	"austen"
"At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain."	"austen"
"Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia."	"austen"
"Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party."	"austen"
"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myselffor I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas."	"austen"
"What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?"	"austen"
"Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all."	"austen"
"However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer."	"austen"
"After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud."	"austen"
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds."	"austen"
"He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it."	"austen"
"That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion."	"austen"
"After a short silence, the lady first spoke."	"austen"
"Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again."	"austen"
"Why did not you all learn?"	"austen"
"It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled."	"austen"
"You are very cruel, said her sister, you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."	"austen"
"The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill health."	"austen"
"With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words delightful, and charming, when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed."	"austen"
"It is from Miss Bingley, said Jane, and then read it aloud."	"austen"
"His pride, said Miss Lucas, does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes' conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing."	"austen"
"There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare say."	"austen"
"And what do you think she said besides?"	"austen"
"She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented."	"austen"
"You have liked many a stupider person."	"austen"
"Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them upthough, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them."	"austen"
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."	"austen"
"When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year."	"austen"
"Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it."	"austen"
"He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away."	"austen"
"After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer."	"austen"
"It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match."	"austen"
"That is very strange."	"austen"
"And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?"	"austen"
"His father was an excellent man, said Mrs. Gardiner."	"austen"
"His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections."	"austen"
"Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game."	"austen"
"The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention."	"austen"
"Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat."	"austen"
"I have found out, said he, by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness."	"austen"
"They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt."	"austen"
"When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful."	"austen"
"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."	"austen"
"This was invitation enough."	"austen"
"How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!"	"austen"
"His manners are very different from his cousin's."	"austen"
"We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton."	"austen"
"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa, said Bingley; but this was all lost upon me."	"austen"
"This must be the grossest falsehood!and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again."	"austen"
"The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants."	"austen"
"I do not believe a word of it, my dear."	"austen"
"You had much better dance."	"austen"
"The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration."	"austen"
"It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in."	"austen"
"From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him."	"austen"
"It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family."	"austen"
"She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!"	"austen"
"About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."	"austen"
"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?"	"austen"
"They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream."	"austen"
"The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better."	"austen"
"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished."	"austen"
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again."	"austen"
"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley."	"austen"
"As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown?"	"austen"
"He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion."	"austen"
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma, said Kitty; who can it be?"	"austen"
"I never saw anyone so shocked."	"austen"
"Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy."	"austen"
"Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour."	"austen"
"Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty."	"austen"
"And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogetherMr."	"austen"
"She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present."	"austen"
"They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world."	"austen"
"That you certainly shall."	"austen"
"My temper I dare not vouch for."	"austen"
"This is quite shocking!"	"austen"
"This is the estimation in which you hold me!"	"austen"
"You give me fresh life and vigour."	"austen"
"They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression."	"austen"
"In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton."	"austen"
"It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life."	"austen"
"Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern."	"austen"
"Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said: I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month."	"austen"
"After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument."	"austen"
"I have seen them both Then it is as I always hoped, cried Jane; they are married!"	"austen"
"She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible."	"austen"
"That is all to be forgot."	"austen"
"my dear, I am quite delighted with him."	"austen"
"They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?"	"austen"
"Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome."	"austen"
"Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them."	"austen"
"Their conduct has been such, replied Elizabeth, as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget."	"austen"
"Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required."	"austen"
"Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom."	"austen"
"The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary."	"austen"
"My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me."	"austen"
"If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight."	"austen"
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"	"austen"
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent."	"austen"
"With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart."	"austen"
"It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever."	"austen"
"Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?"	"austen"
"This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming."	"austen"
"but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."	"austen"
"And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case."	"austen"
"You ought all to have learned."	"austen"
"You blamed me for coming?"	"austen"
"But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!"	"austen"
"True, said Mr. Bennet, but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it."	"austen"
"To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained."	"austen"
"Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor."	"austen"
"His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing."	"austen"
"To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her."	"austen"
"Chapter 60 Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon."	"austen"
"Chapter 29 Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete."	"austen"
"Then, observed Elizabeth, you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman."	"austen"
"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."	"austen"
"cried Elizabeth when she had finished it."	"austen"
"He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity."	"austen"
"What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."	"austen"
"But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered."	"austen"
"It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed: How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!"	"austen"
"I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain."	"austen"
"And what did she say?"	"austen"
"It was as follows: MY DEAR SIR, I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire."	"austen"
"Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married."	"austen"
"There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added: When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."	"austen"
"But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other person."	"austen"
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield, said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."	"austen"
"repeated Darcy contemptuously; yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed."	"austen"
"But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."	"austen"
"I knew, said he, that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary."	"austen"
"It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be."	"austen"
"Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure."	"austen"
"What could be the meaning of it?"	"austen"
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent, said she, did he come at all?"	"austen"
"And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission!"	"austen"
"Had you not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you."	"austen"
"Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile."	"austen"
"While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came."	"austen"
"After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party."	"austen"
"But what, said she, after a pause, can have been his motive?"	"austen"
"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever."	"austen"
"You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party."	"austen"
"noit is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy."	"austen"
"Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth."	"austen"
"Her father lifted up his eyes."	"austen"
"It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining."	"austen"
"Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?"	"austen"
"She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcythat Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week."	"austen"
"This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself."	"austen"
"Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other people's remarks."	"austen"
"Well, and what news does it bringgood or bad?"	"austen"
"Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach."	"austen"
"Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one."	"austen"
"Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections."	"austen"
"But no such recollection befriended her."	"austen"
"Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education."	"austen"
"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled."	"austen"
"But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both."	"austen"
"Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall take place."	"austen"
"By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself."	"austen"
"Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy."	"austen"
"I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at."	"austen"
"He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish."	"austen"
"Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned."	"austen"
"They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects."	"austen"
"We had better go into the avenue."	"austen"
"Sir William did not say much."	"austen"
"Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation."	"austen"
"Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon."	"austen"
"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."	"austen"
"With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms."	"austen"
"Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress."	"austen"
"I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back."	"austen"
"Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again."	"austen"
"And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses."	"austen"
"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty, said Mrs. Bennet, to walk to Oakham Mount this morning."	"austen"
"But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion."	"austen"
"Chapter 48 The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him."	"austen"
"Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes."	"austen"
"I wonder, said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."	"austen"
"I cannot blame myself for having done thus much."	"austen"
"As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables."	"austen"
"the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'"	"austen"
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday."	"austen"
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"	"austen"
"And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."	"austen"
"You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother's permission for this address."	"austen"
"In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible."	"austen"
"Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts."	"austen"
"It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us."	"austen"
"Undoubtedly, replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation."	"austen"
"Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away."	"austen"
"All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes."	"austen"
"Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"	"austen"
"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does."	"austen"
"Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable."	"austen"
"As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying: I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself."	"austen"
"Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth."	"austen"
"This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for."	"austen"
"She did not choose it, said her daughter, she would go."	"austen"
"I am sure, said she, I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller's regiment went away."	"austen"
"Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want."	"austen"
"Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject."	"austen"
"To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to."	"austen"
"She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them."	"austen"
"I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love, said Darcy."	"austen"
"Console Lady Catherine as well as you can."	"austen"
"Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?"	"austen"
"Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days."	"austen"
"You have no compassion for my poor nerves."	"austen"
"But surely, said she, I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."	"austen"
"The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men."	"austen"
"Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable."	"austen"
"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"	"austen"
"Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy."	"austen"
"One came from her books, and the other from her toilette."	"austen"
"But my dear Elizabeth, she added, what sort of girl is Miss King?"	"austen"
"These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber."	"austen"
"they will take care not to outrun their income."	"austen"
"He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry."	"austen"
"At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled."	"austen"
"She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with."	"austen"
"Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father."	"austen"
"Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive."	"austen"
"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?"	"austen"
"She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary."	"austen"
"Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose."	"austen"
"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them."	"austen"
"Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy."	"austen"
"Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before."	"austen"
"On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks."	"austen"
"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?"	"austen"
"His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased."	"austen"
"Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?"	"austen"
"You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty."	"austen"
"And you saw him frequently?"	"austen"
"And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?"	"austen"
"They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia."	"austen"
"I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother."	"austen"
"Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"	"austen"
"They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other."	"austen"
"The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident."	"austen"
"I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds!"	"austen"
"But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good."	"austen"
"I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Janeone does not often see anybody better looking."	"austen"
"Her reflections were in general satisfactory."	"austen"
"In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could."	"austen"
"It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicityto have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment."	"austen"
"Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family."	"austen"
"Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!"	"austen"
"The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh!"	"austen"
"But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the way."	"austen"
"Your affectionate friend, LYDIA BENNET."	"austen"
"I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."	"austen"
"I have by no means done."	"austen"
"I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party."	"austen"
"Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of."	"austen"
"Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?"	"austen"
"It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture."	"austen"
"Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?"	"austen"
"She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy."	"austen"
"Oh, my dear, dear aunt, she rapturously cried, what delight!"	"austen"
"your father of course may spare you, if your mother can."	"austen"
"I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly."	"austen"
"Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard."	"austen"
"Yes, sir, I know I am."	"austen"
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"	"austen"
"The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to townand without any intention of coming back again."	"austen"
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"	"austen"
"And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"	"austen"
"She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself."	"austen"
"Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place."	"austen"
"But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?"	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them."	"austen"
"Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"	"austen"
"His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others."	"austen"
"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."	"austen"
"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting."	"austen"
"When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?"	"austen"
"The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten."	"austen"
"She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door."	"austen"
"She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess."	"austen"
"He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty."	"austen"
"The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door."	"austen"
"My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be."	"austen"
"She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour."	"austen"
"And his sisters are charming women."	"austen"
"Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him."	"austen"
"certainly, cried his faithful assistant, no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with."	"austen"
"If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen."	"austen"
"Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not."	"austen"
"His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire, and of his being gone into the regulars."	"austen"
"He keeps a man-servant, does he?"	"austen"
"Had I but explained some part of it onlysome part of what I learnt, to my own family!"	"austen"
"Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives."	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house."	"austen"
"She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers."	"austen"
"All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over."	"austen"
"It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland."	"austen"
"And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?"	"austen"
"But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation."	"austen"
"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way."	"austen"
"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did."	"austen"
"It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor."	"austen"
"Charlotte herself was tolerably composed."	"austen"
"How I long to see her again!"	"austen"
"At last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her."	"austen"
"But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew."	"austen"
"Elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce."	"austen"
"Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was."	"austen"
"Family pride, and filial pridefor he is very proud of what his father washave done this."	"austen"
"A small sum could not do all this."	"austen"
"She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained."	"austen"
"It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before."	"austen"
"At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters."	"austen"
"I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night."	"austen"
"Chapter 20 Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection."	"austen"
"He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend."	"austen"
"In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away."	"austen"
"But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?"	"austen"
"Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them."	"austen"
"This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away."	"austen"
"You could scarcely escape discredit and misery."	"austen"
"And for this we are to be thankful."	"austen"
"There is nothing the matter with me."	"austen"
"You shall hear what she says."	"austen"
"I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse."	"austen"
"I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit."	"austen"
"When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention."	"austen"
"And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification."	"austen"
"There is nothing he would not do for her."	"austen"
"Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness."	"austen"
"Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.'"	"austen"
"We have not determined how far it shall carry us, said Mrs. Gardiner, but, perhaps, to the Lakes."	"austen"
"Did you speak from your own observation, said she, when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"	"austen"
"Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence."	"austen"
"MY DEAR NIECE, I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you."	"austen"
"She answered him with cold civility."	"austen"
"It is wonderful, replied Wickham, for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend."	"austen"
"Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn."	"austen"
"She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her meansthat she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of herwas a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile."	"austen"
"But I was embarrassed."	"austen"
"At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way!"	"austen"
"It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected."	"austen"
"But our visitor was very obstinate."	"austen"
"Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"	"austen"
"She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening."	"austen"
"She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power."	"austen"
"What congratulations will then flow in!"	"austen"
"She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh, she replied, has very lately given him a living."	"austen"
"Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters."	"austen"
"How long has she been such a favourite?and pray, when am I to wish you joy?"	"austen"
"Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another."	"austen"
"They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."	"austen"
"His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do."	"austen"
"Wretched, wretched mistake!"	"austen"
"That is the place to get husbands."	"austen"
"Too much, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise?"	"austen"
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."	"austen"
"How can you be so silly, cried her mother, as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!"	"austen"
"So much the man of fashion!"	"austen"
"Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it."	"austen"
"Indeed, replied Elizabeth, I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me."	"austen"
"He is certainly a good brother, said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows."	"austen"
"Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself."	"austen"
"She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word."	"austen"
"One ought not to repine;but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!"	"austen"
"No, no, you shall not deceive me."	"austen"
"She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."	"austen"
"You are over-scrupulous, surely."	"austen"
"He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon."	"austen"
"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world."	"austen"
"You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage."	"austen"
"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken."	"austen"
"He had never had the slightest suspicion."	"austen"
"Oh that I had been with you!"	"austen"
"Obstinate, headstrong girl!"	"austen"
"She has two nieces of her own."	"austen"
"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."	"austen"
"But now it was all too natural."	"austen"
"He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her: My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?"	"austen"
"If it was to be secret, said Jane, say not another word on the subject."	"austen"
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me, said she."	"austen"
"I comfort myself with thinking, replied Jane, that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her."	"austen"
"They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family."	"austen"
"He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone."	"austen"
"She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be."	"austen"
"He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before."	"austen"
"By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous."	"austen"
"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments, said Darcy, has too much truth."	"austen"
"You have said quite enough, madam."	"austen"
"My younger sister has left all her friendshas eloped; has thrown herself into the power ofof Mr. Wickham."	"austen"
"Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable."	"austen"
"I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart."	"austen"
"They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered."	"austen"
"And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart."	"austen"
"I must go instantly to my mother; she cried."	"austen"
"His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing."	"austen"
"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"	"austen"
"The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country."	"austen"
"He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it."	"austen"
"The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual."	"austen"
"Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how."	"austen"
"Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been."	"austen"
"The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt."	"austen"
"I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."	"austen"
"I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."	"austen"
"But, however, he did not."	"austen"
"The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words."	"austen"
"It has been a very agreeable day, said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth."	"austen"
"They were, therefore, to go."	"austen"
"The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you."	"austen"
"She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way."	"austen"
"Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with."	"austen"
"You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say."	"austen"
"How can they suit each other?"	"austen"
"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed."	"austen"
"Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said: Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours."	"austen"
"They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland."	"austen"
"It is amazing to me, said Bingley, how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are."	"austen"
"Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister."	"austen"
"As to her younger daughters, she could not take upon her to sayshe could not positively answerbut she did not know of any prepossession; her eldest daughter, she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."	"austen"
"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation."	"austen"
"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth."	"austen"
"Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my witsand have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over mesuch spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day."	"austen"
"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy, replied Jane; but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing."	"austen"
"I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses."	"austen"
"Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her."	"austen"
"I have already told her so once, by your desire."	"austen"
"I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."	"austen"
"I know you will contrive it all."	"austen"
"When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish."	"austen"
"The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her."	"austen"
"The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out: Engaged to Mr. Collins!"	"austen"
"Well, thensupposing them to be in London."	"austen"
"You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."	"austen"
"She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him."	"austen"
"She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success."	"austen"
"Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown."	"austen"
"Miss Bingley told me, said Jane, that he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances."	"austen"
"At present we have nothing to guide us."	"austen"
"He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship, replied Elizabeth with emphasis, and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."	"austen"
"But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill. Lydia declared herself satisfied."	"austen"
"My dear madam, replied he, let us be for ever silent on this point."	"austen"
"Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say."	"austen"
"They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too."	"austen"
"From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting."	"austen"
"What, has she frightened away some of your lovers?"	"austen"
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!"	"austen"
"Mr. Collins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known."	"austen"
"I do not get on at all."	"austen"
"I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers."	"austen"
"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of."	"austen"
"You have a house in town, I conclude?"	"austen"
"But how did he account for it?"	"austen"
"Let me never see either one or the other again!"	"austen"
"what hours of transport we shall spend!"	"austen"
"You shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful."	"austen"
"You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so."	"austen"
"You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction."	"austen"
"When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both."	"austen"
"Haye Park might do, said she, if the Gouldings could quit itor the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off!"	"austen"
"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess, said Darcy, of conversing easily with those I have never seen before."	"austen"
"I never saw such a long chin in my life."	"austen"
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."	"austen"
"The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished."	"austen"
"She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it."	"austen"
"But she is nothing to me now."	"austen"
"Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable."	"austen"
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle."	"austen"
"to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him."	"austen"
"Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined."	"austen"
"Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance."	"austen"
"A person may be proud without being vain."	"austen"
"She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."	"austen"
"I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford."	"austen"
"Why should he have it more than anybody else?"	"austen"
"cried Jane, what do you mean, sir?"	"austen"
"With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed: Good Lord!"	"austen"
"If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them."	"austen"
"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing."	"austen"
"She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture."	"austen"
"They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are."	"austen"
"Perhaps he thought her too young."	"austen"
"To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting."	"austen"
"It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man."	"austen"
"I beg you will not go."	"austen"
"He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable."	"austen"
"In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house."	"austen"
"Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first."	"austen"
"I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe."	"austen"
"The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her."	"austen"
"You tear them to pieces."	"austen"
"Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business."	"austen"
"You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!"	"austen"
"There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself."	"austen"
"She was overpowered by shame and vexation."	"austen"
"Excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant."	"austen"
"For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's; but you shall do as you choose."	"austen"
"Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter."	"austen"
"She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed."	"austen"
"It is not quite a week since they left Brighton."	"austen"
"On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower."	"austen"
"It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions."	"austen"
"My father and Maria are coming to me in March, added Charlotte, and I hope you will consent to be of the party."	"austen"
"At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken."	"austen"
"Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"	"austen"
"No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it."	"austen"
"You see how continually we are engaged there."	"austen"
"And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house."	"austen"
"Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable."	"austen"
"I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again."	"austen"
"Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved."	"austen"
"She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter."	"austen"
"Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned."	"austen"
"Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief?"	"austen"
"But, really, I know not what to say."	"austen"
"It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world."	"austen"
"Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate."	"austen"
"To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed."	"austen"
"This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town."	"austen"
"It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance."	"austen"
"The visit was soon returned in due form."	"austen"
"To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own."	"austen"
"My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."	"austen"
"He has heartily forgiven me now."	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking her hand said in reply: Do not make yourself uneasy, my love."	"austen"
"Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent togetherand four evenings may do a great deal."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."	"austen"
"With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round."	"austen"
"I was so vexed to see him stand up with her!"	"austen"
"He should be particularly happy at any time, etc."	"austen"
"She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty."	"austen"
"I have not been used to submit to any person's whims."	"austen"
"But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate."	"austen"
"However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham."	"austen"
"She declared her resolution."	"austen"
"At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable."	"austen"
"The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen."	"austen"
"And what claims has Lydiawhat attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?"	"austen"
"The son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for."	"austen"
"Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's."	"austen"
"When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her."	"austen"
"I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."	"austen"
"His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away."	"austen"
"They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt."	"austen"
"Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation."	"austen"
"cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her."	"austen"
"We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon."	"austen"
"Read it aloud, said their father, for I hardly know myself what it is about."	"austen"
"Chapter 12 In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day."	"austen"
"With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!"	"austen"
"She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken."	"austen"
"Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock."	"austen"
"What can be the meaning of this?"	"austen"
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"	"austen"
"Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth."	"austen"
"I am sorry it went off."	"austen"
"A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk."	"austen"
"Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere."	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character."	"austen"
"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."	"austen"
"We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome."	"austen"
"Is not he a charming man?"	"austen"
"It is almost past belief."	"austen"
"You may readily comprehend, she added, what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time."	"austen"
"Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine seemed pleased."	"austen"
"I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."	"austen"
"Elizabeth immediately began playing again."	"austen"
"My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says."	"austen"
"Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday."	"austen"
"You cannot have been always at Longbourn."	"austen"
"He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments."	"austen"
"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane, said she."	"austen"
"They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought."	"austen"
"This fine account of him, whispered her aunt as they walked, is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."	"austen"
"To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer."	"austen"
"But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment."	"austen"
"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."	"austen"
"But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied."	"austen"
"He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal."	"austen"
"Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way."	"austen"
"Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance."	"austen"
"Elizabeth was delighted."	"austen"
"But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle."	"austen"
"Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance."	"austen"
"I am not afraid of her dying."	"austen"
"I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you."	"austen"
"That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice."	"austen"
"If he had another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him."	"austen"
"We will be down as soon as we can, said Jane; but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."	"austen"
"From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent."	"austen"
"She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery."	"austen"
"He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday."	"austen"
"People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking."	"austen"
"As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery."	"austen"
"Can this be Mr. Darcy?"	"austen"
"I cannot think so very ill of Wickham."	"austen"
"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish."	"austen"
"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?"	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast."	"austen"
"And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age."	"austen"
"Let me hear what it is."	"austen"
"From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's long letter; but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write."	"austen"
"She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject."	"austen"
"But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him."	"austen"
"However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters."	"austen"
"Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition."	"austen"
"Chapter 22 The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins."	"austen"
"Now what have you to say?"	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?"	"austen"
"Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours."	"austen"
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I wouldI do congratulate youbut are you certain?"	"austen"
"Whatever my connections may be, said Elizabeth, if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you."	"austen"
"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?"	"austen"
"When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room."	"austen"
"From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them."	"austen"
"The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence."	"austen"
"What you ask, said Elizabeth, is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter."	"austen"
"At least, you should not remind your mother of inviting him."	"austen"
"They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants."	"austen"
"I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine."	"austen"
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may."	"austen"
"There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord , and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him."	"austen"
"yesit would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again."	"austen"
"He then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn."	"austen"
"A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying: Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!"	"austen"
"Darcy said nothing at all."	"austen"
"He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world."	"austen"
"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."	"austen"
"It is evident that you belong to the first circles."	"austen"
"I am sick of Mr. Bingley, cried his wife."	"austen"
"Do you prefer reading to cards?"	"austen"
"It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way."	"austen"
"I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable."	"austen"
"Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay."	"austen"
"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable."	"austen"
"cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment."	"austen"
"After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth, I hope you are well, Miss Bennet."	"austen"
"Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room."	"austen"
"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know."	"austen"
"He is so excessively handsome!"	"austen"
"For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody."	"austen"
"That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certainbut I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears."	"austen"
"I have not that pain."	"austen"
"If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy."	"austen"
"His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy."	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet made no answer."	"austen"
"The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas!"	"austen"
"A clergyman like you must marry."	"austen"
"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy."	"austen"
"Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating, Why is he so altered?"	"austen"
"Let me do it without further loss of time."	"austen"
"Elizabeth now began to revive."	"austen"
"Perfectly so, I thank you."	"austen"
"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical."	"austen"
"They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to."	"austen"
"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."	"austen"
"He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner."	"austen"
"You must learn some of my philosophy."	"austen"
"This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place."	"austen"
"The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?"	"austen"
"Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way."	"austen"
"Her report was highly favourable."	"austen"
"I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer."	"austen"
"In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library."	"austen"
"A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter."	"austen"
"Chapter 7 Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his."	"austen"
"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you."	"austen"
"Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia."	"austen"
"Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me."	"austen"
"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."	"austen"
"He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him."	"austen"
"She inquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry."	"austen"
"Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise."	"austen"
"It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was."	"austen"
"Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head."	"austen"
"And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if they should be of use to us."	"austen"
"and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time."	"austen"
"They must have seen them together for ever."	"austen"
"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy, said her father, to send for the horses?"	"austen"
"As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind."	"austen"
"She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth."	"austen"
"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself."	"austen"
"I am trying to make it out."	"austen"
"She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him."	"austen"
"What do you mean, Hill?"	"austen"
"I will put on my things in a moment."	"austen"
"Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot."	"austen"
"Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners."	"austen"
"To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligenceElizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough."	"austen"
"Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."	"austen"
"They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance."	"austen"
"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy."	"austen"
"As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch."	"austen"
"The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter."	"austen"
"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect."	"austen"
"I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them."	"austen"
"Let me mend it for you."	"austen"
"She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son."	"austen"
"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?"	"austen"
"Why did you not seek legal redress?"	"austen"
"Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed."	"austen"
"You are safe from me."	"austen"
"We have heard nothing from town."	"austen"
"The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable."	"austen"
"If I could but see you as happy!"	"austen"
"She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct."	"austen"
"Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented."	"austen"
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."	"austen"
"Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of Lord, how tired I am!"	"austen"
"But his pride, his abominable pridehis shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Janehis unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited."	"austen"
"On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."	"austen"
"Have you had any flirting?"	"austen"
"The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news."	"austen"
"cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction."	"austen"
"How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!"	"austen"
"Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it."	"austen"
"He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage."	"austen"
"Now I am quite happy, said she, for you will be as happy as myself."	"austen"
"Is not this an agreeable surprise?"	"austen"
"It ought to be good, he replied, it has been the work of many generations."	"austen"
"I would go and see her if I could have the carriage."	"austen"
"I hope, said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after officers."	"austen"
"I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."	"austen"
"She could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded."	"austen"
"She saw all the glories of the campits tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once."	"austen"
"we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's."	"austen"
"cried Elizabeth, I am excessively diverted."	"austen"
"And I certainly never shall give it."	"austen"
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas, he continued, let us return to Mr. Bingley."	"austen"
"You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice."	"austen"
"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins, she added, that Lizzy shall be brought to reason."	"austen"
"Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London."	"austen"
"Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence."	"austen"
"I should not be surprised, said Darcy, if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers."	"austen"
"I am astonished, said Miss Bingley, that my father should have left so small a collection of books."	"austen"
"I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it."	"austen"
"I talked about the dance, and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."	"austen"
"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man."	"austen"
"Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life."	"austen"
"That he should have been in love with her for so many months!"	"austen"
"The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn."	"austen"
"Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!"	"austen"
"While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever."	"austen"
"Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied."	"austen"
"Yet it is hard, she sometimes thought, that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation!"	"austen"
"In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!"	"austen"
"I am sure Lizzy will be very happyI am sure she can have no objection."	"austen"
"Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank."	"austen"
"But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King."	"austen"
"It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."	"austen"
"I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly."	"austen"
"The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings."	"austen"
"She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention."	"austen"
"Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done."	"austen"
"Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend."	"austen"
"She inquired after his sister, but could do no more."	"austen"
"Seriously, I would have you be on your guard."	"austen"
"Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece."	"austen"
"Perhaps it would have been better, replied her sister."	"austen"
"More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed."	"austen"
"I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."	"austen"
"Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject."	"austen"
"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."	"austen"
"I, who knew what he was."	"austen"
"But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding."	"austen"
"Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted."	"austen"
"It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane."	"austen"
"He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her."	"austen"
"With them he is remarkably agreeable."	"austen"
"When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short."	"austen"
"It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of."	"austen"
"Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this!"	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings."	"austen"
"It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq."	"austen"
"Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting."	"austen"
"Nobody wants him to come."	"austen"
"Elizabeth went away with her head full of him."	"austen"
"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid hadnot turned out well."	"austen"
"She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance."	"austen"
"Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept."	"austen"
"She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?"	"austen"
"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him."	"austen"
"The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen."	"austen"
"She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her."	"austen"
"Such as vanity and pride."	"austen"
"She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before."	"austen"
"It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration."	"austen"
"How despicably I have acted!"	"austen"
"how he must have felt it!"	"austen"
"As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to."	"austen"
"The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be."	"austen"
"I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."	"austen"
"Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!"	"austen"
"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"	"austen"
"No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection."	"austen"
"I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."	"austen"
"His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature."	"austen"
"Do let us have a little music, cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share."	"austen"
"Well, much good may it do them!"	"austen"
"said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone."	"austen"
"I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy."	"austen"
"At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner."	"austen"
"In understanding, Darcy was the superior."	"austen"
"We do not suffer by accident."	"austen"
"I have said no such thing."	"austen"
"But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happyyour affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt."	"austen"
"Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter."	"austen"
"I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl."	"austen"
"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"	"austen"
"Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself."	"austen"
"Those who do not complain are never pitied."	"austen"
"You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."	"austen"
"She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him."	"austen"
"Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great."	"austen"
"We must not make him desperate."	"austen"
"Nothing child, nothing."	"austen"
"Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it."	"austen"
"What are young men to rocks and mountains?"	"austen"
"and having to relate such a thing of his sister!"	"austen"
"But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was."	"austen"
"My dear Mr. Bennet, said his lady to him one day, have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"	"austen"
"The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks."	"austen"
"The adieu is charity itself."	"austen"
"She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away."	"austen"
"I think I have heard you say that you know them."	"austen"
"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property."	"austen"
"Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable."	"austen"
"Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth."	"austen"
"In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, Go to your father, he wants you in the library."	"austen"
"Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!"	"austen"
"Really, Mr. Collins, cried Elizabeth with some warmth, you puzzle me exceedingly."	"austen"
"In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost."	"austen"
"It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her."	"austen"
"She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."	"austen"
"She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend."	"austen"
"I hate such false friends."	"austen"
"He heard her attentively, and then said: Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances."	"austen"
"Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?"	"austen"
"Can you come to-morrow?"	"austen"
"But I know the foundation is unjust."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began."	"austen"
"Bingley and his sisters."	"austen"
"And how impossible in others!"	"austen"
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth?"	"austen"
"She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."	"austen"
"Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."	"austen"
"So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next."	"austen"
"Jane was by no means better."	"austen"
"I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it."	"austen"
"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him."	"austen"
"Dear madam, cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner?"	"austen"
"It cannot be concealed from anyone."	"austen"
"There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody."	"austen"
"I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."	"austen"
"Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out."	"austen"
"Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous."	"austen"
"Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation."	"austen"
"There is nothing else to be done."	"austen"
"A great deal more passed at the other table."	"austen"
"After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her: Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"	"austen"
"I am excessively attentive to all those things."	"austen"
"As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was."	"austen"
"Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain."	"austen"
"I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong."	"austen"
"He must be an oddity, I think, said she."	"austen"
"He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear."	"austen"
"It must have been his sister's doing."	"austen"
"It is of all subjects my delight."	"austen"
"Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all."	"austen"
"I have heard much of your master's fine person, said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; it is a handsome face."	"austen"
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her, said Lady Catherine; and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal."	"austen"
"Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her."	"austen"
"He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it."	"austen"
"Chapter 35 Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes."	"austen"
"The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me."	"austen"
"He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hourwas pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately."	"austen"
"Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress!"	"austen"
"He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided."	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself."	"austen"
"Our importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character."	"austen"
"Neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach."	"austen"
"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you?"	"austen"
"I knew how it would be."	"austen"
"Is it not clear enough?"	"austen"
"She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect."	"austen"
"The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected."	"austen"
"She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house."	"austen"
"I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here."	"austen"
"And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon."	"austen"
"I would not be so fastidious as you are, cried Mr. Bingley, for a kingdom!"	"austen"
"Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance."	"austen"
"She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet."	"austen"
"Chapter 32 Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor."	"austen"
"Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy."	"austen"
"I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it."	"austen"
"Yes, replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, but that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."	"austen"
"She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her."	"austen"
"Do not wish me such an evil."	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently."	"austen"
"If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him."	"austen"
"Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life."	"austen"
"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good, added Kitty."	"austen"
"She will not be able to help calling."	"austen"
"Yesthe late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift."	"austen"
"I described, and enforced them earnestly."	"austen"
"Aye, there she comes, continued Mrs. Bennet, looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way."	"austen"
"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."	"austen"
"Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected."	"austen"
"I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too."	"austen"
"She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley."	"austen"
"His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire."	"austen"
"The arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning's impatience."	"austen"
"It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum."	"austen"
"I shall now know how to act."	"austen"
"NoI cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was."	"austen"
"He arranges the business just as he pleases."	"austen"
"Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed."	"austen"
"But that is nothing to us."	"austen"
"I often think, said she, that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends."	"austen"
"His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham."	"austen"
"In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off."	"austen"
"Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged."	"austen"
"A few weeks, he believed."	"austen"
"A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year."	"austen"
"To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further."	"austen"
"He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others."	"austen"
"On both sides it was only assertion."	"austen"
"But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph."	"austen"
"I must not decide on my own performance."	"austen"
"I am not one-and-twenty."	"austen"
"Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master."	"austen"
"We were always good friends; and now we are better."	"austen"
"People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true."	"austen"
"Not at all, was her answer; but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it."	"austen"
"But the clothes, the wedding clothes!"	"austen"
"I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister."	"austen"
"There was also a postscript to this effect: I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself."	"austen"
"He was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey."	"austen"
"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match."	"austen"
"The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together."	"austen"
"A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago."	"austen"
"To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!"	"austen"
"Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.'"	"austen"
"Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair."	"austen"
"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."	"austen"
"The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground."	"austen"
"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough."	"austen"
"This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."	"austen"
"My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it."	"austen"
"Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously."	"austen"
"They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines."	"austen"
"This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once."	"austen"
"My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church."	"austen"
"As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring."	"austen"
"cried he, turning towards her."	"austen"
"His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing."	"austen"
"Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together."	"austen"
"This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself."	"austen"
"Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all others."	"austen"
"Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side."	"austen"
"No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it."	"austen"
"He drew a chair near her."	"austen"
"Certainly, replied Elizabeththere are such people, but I hope I am not one of them."	"austen"
"She looks sickly and cross."	"austen"
"And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins."	"austen"
"To Jane herself, she exclaimed, there could be no possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating."	"austen"
"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?"	"austen"
"What think you of books?"	"austen"
"The moment of her release from him was ecstasy."	"austen"
"Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer."	"austen"
"How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?"	"austen"
"She certainly did not hate him."	"austen"
"With my mother up stairs."	"austen"
"For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path."	"austen"
"My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for."	"austen"
"When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter."	"austen"
"He is the best landlord, and the best master, said she, that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste."	"austen"
"They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about."	"austen"
"On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy."	"austen"
"You began the evening well, Charlotte, said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas."	"austen"
"There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us."	"austen"
"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?"	"austen"
"Dear Sir, The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance."	"austen"
"The present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it?"	"austen"
"Chapter 13 I hope, my dear, said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."	"austen"
"I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say."	"austen"
"Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much."	"austen"
"All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot."	"austen"
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"	"austen"
"Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest."	"austen"
"She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise."	"austen"
"The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a balland at this ball, what do you think he did?"	"austen"
"He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself."	"austen"
"Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter."	"austen"
"The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken."	"austen"
"One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight."	"austen"
"Her not objecting does not justify him."	"austen"
"His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind."	"austen"
"I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."	"austen"
"For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof."	"austen"
"The girls stared at their father."	"austen"
"Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better."	"austen"
"But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off."	"austen"
"All young ladies accomplished!"	"austen"
"You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last."	"austen"
"'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.'"	"austen"
"I thank you for my share of the favour, said Elizabeth; but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."	"austen"
"The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham."	"austen"
"Nobody can tell what I suffer!"	"austen"
"Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his design."	"austen"
"thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!"	"austen"
"But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments."	"austen"
"Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk."	"austen"
"From their infancy, they have been intended for each other."	"austen"
"I have been making the tour of the park, he replied, as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage."	"austen"
"Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves."	"austen"
"There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."	"austen"
"When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin and so small."	"austen"
"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony."	"austen"
"Mr. Wickham began the subject himself."	"austen"
"Whatever I do is done in a hurry, replied he; and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes."	"austen"
"Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it."	"austen"
"But I confess they would have no charms for meI should infinitely prefer a book."	"austen"
"A man who has once been refused!"	"austen"
"In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness."	"austen"
"They were in  street."	"austen"
"and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule."	"austen"
"They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him."	"austen"
"I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted."	"austen"
"Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man."	"austen"
"It may perhaps be pleasant, replied Charlotte, to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them."	"austen"
"His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured."	"austen"
"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility."	"austen"
"The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt."	"austen"
"To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement."	"austen"
"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time."	"austen"
"We are speaking of music, madam, said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply."	"austen"
"After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses."	"austen"
"Chapter 33 More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy."	"austen"
"You are very ill. No, I thank you, she replied, endeavouring to recover herself."	"austen"
"Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well."	"austen"
"As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth."	"austen"
"Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business."	"austen"
"This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled."	"austen"
"A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern."	"austen"
"They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself."	"austen"
"* * * * * It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey."	"austen"
"You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf."	"austen"
"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed."	"austen"
"or had you intended any more serious consequence?"	"austen"
"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy."	"austen"
"She liked him too little to care for his approbation."	"austen"
"She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times."	"austen"
"Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one without involving the other."	"austen"
"Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency."	"austen"
"Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?"	"austen"
"Then after a short silence he continued: Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind."	"austen"
"When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time."	"austen"
"How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine."	"austen"
"I knew you would be wishing me joy."	"austen"
"And she rose as she spoke."	"austen"
"Till this moment I never knew myself."	"austen"
"What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"	"austen"
"Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe is a great friend of Darcy's."	"austen"
"The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention."	"austen"
"Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications."	"austen"
"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"	"austen"
"I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson's room."	"austen"
"Well girls, said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, What say you to the day?"	"austen"
"How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine."	"austen"
"Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged."	"austen"
"Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me."	"austen"
"Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley."	"austen"
"Elizabeth could not help saying, It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."	"austen"
"Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her."	"austen"
"She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room."	"austen"
"It must be an amusing study."	"austen"
"He was very fond of them."	"austen"
"She followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!"	"austen"
"I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about herwho could about such a nasty little freckled thing?"	"austen"
"After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed: From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country."	"austen"
"Lizzy, you must not do so."	"austen"
"Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."	"austen"
"He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself."	"austen"
"* * * * * Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother."	"austen"
"Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage."	"austen"
"He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning."	"austen"
"You dislike an argument, and want to silence this."	"austen"
"Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings."	"austen"
"Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age."	"austen"
"One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself."	"austen"
"Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"	"austen"
"and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men."	"austen"
"But does not Jane correspond with his sister?"	"austen"
"Make haste, and come down this moment."	"austen"
"The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees."	"austen"
"As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer."	"austen"
"Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her."	"austen"
"But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion."	"austen"
"She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what."	"austen"
"As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper."	"austen"
"Though it is difficult, said Jane, to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."	"austen"
"My dear Mr. Bennet, cried his wife, what are you talking of?"	"austen"
"From what we have seen of him, continued Mrs. Gardiner, I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham."	"austen"
"They must be a great loss to your family."	"austen"
"forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"	"austen"
"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"	"austen"
"Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort."	"austen"
"When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer."	"austen"
"Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead."	"austen"
"my dear father, she cried, come back and write immediately."	"austen"
"Besides, there was truth in his looks."	"austen"
"I am very, very sorry."	"austen"
"He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend."	"austen"
"Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."	"austen"
"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"	"austen"
"The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters."	"austen"
"Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies."	"austen"
"I am not ashamed of having been mistakenor, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters."	"austen"
"I will only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection."	"austen"
"Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford."	"austen"
"Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"	"austen"
"Ten thousand a year, and very likely more!"	"austen"
"It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said: I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed."	"austen"
"I hope they will not meet at all."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise."	"austen"
"thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you."	"austen"
"But will they make you happy?"	"austen"
"The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more."	"austen"
"She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise."	"austen"
"Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said: I did not know before that you ever walked this way."	"austen"
"Chapter 42 Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort."	"austen"
"And she was only sixteen last June."	"austen"
"Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again."	"austen"
"A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love."	"austen"
"Yours, very sincerely, M. GARDINER."	"austen"
"How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"	"austen"
"He takes them now for people of fashion."	"austen"
"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"	"austen"
"the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"	"austen"
"She practises very constantly."	"austen"
"Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."	"austen"
"But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her."	"austen"
"Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome."	"austen"
"Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur."	"austen"
"It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been."	"austen"
"Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her."	"austen"
"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?"	"austen"
"Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things I know are all chance in this world."	"austen"
"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again."	"austen"
"Does she live near you, sir?"	"austen"
"They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering."	"austen"
"Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?"	"austen"
"I shall not say you are mistaken, he replied, because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."	"austen"
"Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home."	"austen"
"As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness."	"austen"
"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year!"	"austen"
"She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become stupid, disagreeable fellows."	"austen"
"After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn."	"austen"
"I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."	"austen"
"I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement."	"austen"
"Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will."	"austen"
"was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs."	"austen"
"Darcy smiled and said, You are perfectly right."	"austen"
"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe."	"austen"
"All field sports were over."	"austen"
"One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth: Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe."	"austen"
"I am impatient to see him."	"austen"
"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."	"austen"
"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you, said Elizabeth."	"austen"
"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model."	"austen"
"His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost."	"austen"
"Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet."	"austen"
"I am so pleasedso happy."	"austen"
"I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very welland, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals."	"austen"
"We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."	"austen"
"She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous."	"austen"
"When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music."	"austen"
"How are they even to be discovered?"	"austen"
"Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail."	"austen"
"Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room."	"austen"
"Where is your sister?"	"austen"
"She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks."	"austen"
"To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia."	"austen"
"pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before."	"austen"
"You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk."	"austen"
"She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible."	"austen"
"I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago."	"austen"
"But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined."	"austen"
"I thought I should have broken my heart."	"austen"
"Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time."	"austen"
"Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life."	"austen"
"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."	"austen"
"Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire."	"austen"
"Have not you always hated him?"	"austen"
"I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been."	"austen"
"Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another."	"austen"
"It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows: Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you."	"austen"
"Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it."	"austen"
"All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil."	"austen"
"They have none of them much to recommend them, replied he; they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar."	"austen"
"It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to."	"austen"
"Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family."	"austen"
"It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, Say nothing of that."	"austen"
"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh, said Elizabeth."	"austen"
"His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it."	"austen"
"or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?"	"austen"
"Elizabeth Bennet, said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds."	"austen"
"I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections."	"austen"
"It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention."	"austen"
"Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."	"austen"
"I am afraid you will be angry."	"austen"
"I cannot do justice to his kindness."	"austen"
"When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so."	"austen"
"As long as she stays there, it is all very well."	"austen"
"But of all the views which his garden, or which the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house."	"austen"
"I assure you, madam, he replied, that she does not need such advice."	"austen"
"That is the most unforgiving speech, said Elizabeth, that I ever heard you utter."	"austen"
"You are joking, Lizzy."	"austen"
"But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was."	"austen"
"From what can it proceed?"	"austen"
"How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!"	"austen"
"Darcy had walked away to another part of the room."	"austen"
"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?"	"austen"
"Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out: Oh, papa, what newswhat news?"	"austen"
"And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information?"	"austen"
"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice."	"austen"
"She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham."	"austen"
"Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame."	"austen"
"Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected."	"austen"
"No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph."	"austen"
"As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister."	"austen"
"If we make haste, said Lydia, as they walked along, perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes."	"austen"
"I am not going to run away, papa, said Kitty fretfully."	"austen"
"Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense."	"austen"
"If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning."	"austen"
"But you do not know all."	"austen"
"Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?for I dare not hope, he continued in a lower and more serious tone, that he is improved in essentials."	"austen"
"Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"	"austen"
"I cannot pretend to be sorry, said Wickham, after a short interruption, that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen."	"austen"
"Mrs. Annesley is with her."	"austen"
"My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out."	"austen"
"Chapter 40 Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself."	"austen"
"Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes."	"austen"
"There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies."	"austen"
"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind."	"austen"
"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you."	"austen"
"Yet, how just a humiliation!"	"austen"
"No, said her father; Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied: The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind."	"austen"
"No, said Colonel Fitzwilliam, that is an advantage which he must divide with me."	"austen"
"He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else."	"austen"
"Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful."	"austen"
"Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane."	"austen"
"Well, well, I only hope it will last."	"austen"
"Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possibleadvice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard."	"austen"
"I am not equal to it."	"austen"
"With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn."	"austen"
"Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease."	"austen"
"In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them."	"austen"
"It must be his own doing."	"austen"
"How wonderfully these sort of things occur!"	"austen"
"It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham."	"austen"
"If, indeed, it should be so!"	"austen"
"I had not an idea of it."	"austen"
"After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful."	"austen"
"I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing."	"austen"
"He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere."	"austen"
"Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business."	"austen"
"Perhaps we might be deceived."	"austen"
"He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true."	"austen"
"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"	"austen"
"Her power was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace."	"austen"
"The very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh."	"austen"
"You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas."	"austen"
"And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?"	"austen"
"My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due."	"austen"
"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."	"austen"
"Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them."	"austen"
"Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation."	"austen"
"And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable."	"austen"
"At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house."	"austen"
"it must be my uncle's doings!"	"austen"
"Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice!"	"austen"
"But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes placewhich, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years."	"austen"
"Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."	"austen"
"For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey."	"austen"
"Perhaps she is full young to be much in company."	"austen"
"Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!"	"austen"
"Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation."	"austen"
"But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow."	"austen"
"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did."	"austen"
"To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go."	"austen"
"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family."	"austen"
"I see what you are feeling, replied Charlotte."	"austen"
"She now lost every expectation of pleasure."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight."	"austen"
"Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind!"	"austen"
"As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park."	"austen"
"That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me."	"austen"
"She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years."	"austen"
"When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley."	"austen"
"But I must tell you how it went off."	"austen"
"When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn."	"austen"
"She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said: By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?"	"austen"
"She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done."	"austen"
"Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits."	"austen"
"There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much."	"austen"
"You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him."	"austen"
"Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention."	"austen"
"The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice: Are you pleased with Kent?"	"austen"
"You judge very properly, said Mr. Bennet, and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy."	"austen"
"The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."	"austen"
"The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"	"austen"
"He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard."	"austen"
"Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power."	"austen"
"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"	"austen"
"It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."	"austen"
"They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruitof everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject."	"austen"
"I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town."	"austen"
"You may well warn me against such an evil."	"austen"
"I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family."	"austen"
"She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge."	"austen"
"Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it."	"austen"
"for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well."	"austen"
"But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication."	"austen"
"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours."	"austen"
"Oh, yes!he was to come there with Wickham, you know."	"austen"
"It was really a very handsome thought."	"austen"
"And what am I to do on the occasion?"	"austen"
"The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune."	"austen"
"And when I returned home, the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time."	"austen"
"She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings."	"austen"
"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself."	"austen"
"I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes."	"austen"
"But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure."	"austen"
"In this danger Kitty also is comprehended."	"austen"
"But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents."	"austen"
"Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention."	"austen"
"Yes, all of them, I think."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed."	"austen"
"Her colour changed, and she said no more."	"austen"
"Miss Eliza Bennet, said Miss Bingley, despises cards."	"austen"
"But it is not merely this affair, she continued, on which my dislike is founded."	"austen"
"But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?"	"austen"
"Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected."	"austen"
"In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived."	"austen"
"Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her."	"austen"
"Yes, very indifferent indeed, said Elizabeth, laughingly."	"austen"
"Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?"	"austen"
"It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army."	"austen"
"Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed."	"austen"
"His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence."	"austen"
"such an openness and gentleness in his manner!"	"austen"
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"	"austen"
"And have you answered the letter?"	"austen"
"I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle."	"austen"
"Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room."	"austen"
"But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me."	"austen"
"She had better have stayed at home, cried Elizabeth; perhaps she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours."	"austen"
"Where is your sash, my dear?"	"austen"
"They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life."	"austen"
"How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?"	"austen"
"Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said: You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner."	"austen"
"Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?"	"austen"
"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever."	"austen"
"These causes must be stated, though briefly."	"austen"
"Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself."	"austen"
"She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give."	"austen"
"And may I ask said Elizabeth; but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."	"austen"
"Chapter 39 It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of , in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs."	"austen"
"No really, replied Elizabeth; I think there cannot be too little said on the subject."	"austen"
"To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed."	"austen"
"With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations."	"austen"
"The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this."	"austen"
"Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection."	"austen"
"What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand!"	"austen"
"I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!"	"austen"
"Believe her to be deceived, by all means."	"austen"
"When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm."	"austen"
"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."	"austen"
"If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, WILLIAM COLLINS At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman, said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter."	"austen"
"And that I suppose is one of your sisters."	"austen"
"I do not trust my own partiality."	"austen"
"She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents."	"austen"
"said she, when the door was shut."	"austen"
"But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable."	"austen"
"Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty."	"austen"
"Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep."	"austen"
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me."	"austen"
"She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners."	"austen"
"Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs."	"austen"
"In that case he would return no more."	"austen"
"There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself."	"austen"
"I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before."	"austen"
"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge."	"austen"
"I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character."	"austen"
"Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine then observed, Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think."	"austen"
"I did not wink at you."	"austen"
"But of course she did not mention my name to you."	"austen"
"If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long."	"austen"
"He was full of joy and attention."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day."	"austen"
"I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children."	"austen"
"Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly."	"austen"
"You have sense, and we all expect you to use it."	"austen"
"Chapter 2 Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley."	"austen"
"With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return."	"austen"
"By all means, cried Bingley; let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of."	"austen"
"He heard her with astonishment."	"austen"
"On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared."	"austen"
"I saw them the night before last."	"austen"
"His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips."	"austen"
"The insipidity, and yet the noisethe nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people!"	"austen"
"I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice."	"austen"
"I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere is no occasion for anything more."	"austen"
"I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately."	"austen"
"No, my dear, I think not."	"austen"
"Very true; and if I had my will, we should."	"austen"
"My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."	"austen"
"She grew absolutely ashamed of herself."	"austen"
"You must contrive to send somebody."	"austen"
"No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose."	"austen"
"Who should suffer but myself?"	"austen"
"I expected you to stay two months."	"austen"
"The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister."	"austen"
"Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course."	"austen"
"In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction."	"austen"
"Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention!"	"austen"
"You will not be fit to be seen when you get there."	"austen"
"You supposed more than really existed."	"austen"
"Yes, and I had heard it before."	"austen"
"It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else."	"austen"
"Single, my dear, to be sure!"	"austen"
"I am sure you will be very comfortable there.Yours, etc."	"austen"
"Not one party, or scheme, or anything."	"austen"
"Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it."	"austen"
"The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him."	"austen"
"It pains me to offend you."	"austen"
"They found Mr. Bennet still up."	"austen"
"Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield."	"austen"
"As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement."	"austen"
"Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure."	"austen"
"The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted."	"austen"
"My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own."	"austen"
"But he is an ugly fellow!"	"austen"
"Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation."	"austen"
"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy may hug himself."	"austen"
"Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find."	"austen"
"But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."	"austen"
"Yes, indeed, cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood."	"austen"
"Elizabeth made no answer."	"austen"
"My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me."	"austen"
"I hope you will drink to our good journey."	"austen"
"You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.'"	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her."	"austen"
"To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations."	"austen"
"Elizabeth was forced to go."	"austen"
"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this mannerin such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion."	"austen"
"She will follow wherever Lydia leads."	"austen"
"The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend."	"austen"
"After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy."	"austen"
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them, said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak."	"austen"
"Not as you represent it."	"austen"
"Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was."	"austen"
"my dear Mr. Bennet, as she entered the room, we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy!and so it does, I vow."	"austen"
"Mr. Bingley followed his advice."	"austen"
"Elizabeth was distressed."	"austen"
"The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt."	"austen"
"We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money."	"austen"
"Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room."	"austen"
"She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable."	"austen"
"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?"	"austen"
"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."	"austen"
"At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself."	"austen"
"She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley."	"austen"
"In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam."	"austen"
"Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry."	"austen"
"Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately."	"austen"
"When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure."	"austen"
"If I had been able, said she, to carry my point in going to Brighton, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her."	"austen"
"Elizabeth did not know what to make of it."	"austen"
"A thousand things may arise in six months!"	"austen"
"And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much."	"austen"
"Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters."	"austen"
"No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought afterthe very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy."	"austen"
"Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents: You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right."	"austen"
"Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that."	"austen"
"With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged."	"austen"
"said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, then she is better off than many girls."	"austen"
"I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly."	"austen"
"It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man."	"austen"
"Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing."	"austen"
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age."	"austen"
"Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not goand at another word, might stay a month."	"austen"
"How is half such a sum to be repaid?"	"austen"
"He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!"	"austen"
"Oh, yes!that, that is the worst of all."	"austen"
"She approached and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece."	"austen"
"Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."	"austen"
"The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right."	"austen"
"Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you."	"austen"
"If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!"	"austen"
"Everything nourishes what is strong already."	"austen"
"Elizabeth looked surprised."	"austen"
"They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence."	"austen"
"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable."	"austen"
"Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger If he had had any compassion for me, cried her husband impatiently, he would not have danced half so much!"	"austen"
"But, he added, you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here."	"austen"
"In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."	"austen"
"It only shows her being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling."	"austen"
"Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown."	"austen"
"She will be taken good care of."	"austen"
"There is also one other person in the party, he continued after a pause, who more particularly wishes to be known to you."	"austen"
"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him."	"austen"
"I know no harm of her."	"austen"
"That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it."	"austen"
"Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind."	"austen"
"But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished."	"austen"
"accompanied by a violent yawn."	"austen"
"Chapter 44 Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning."	"austen"
"I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude."	"austen"
"I must ask whether you were surprised?"	"austen"
"A lively imagination soon settled it all."	"austen"
"I am grieved indeed, cried Darcy; grievedshocked."	"austen"
"That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny."	"austen"
"She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine."	"austen"
"But of this answer Lydia heard not a word."	"austen"
"But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation."	"austen"
"Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears."	"austen"
"cried Miss Bingley, Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable."	"austen"
"I will only add, God bless you."	"austen"
"At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said: And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!"	"austen"
"If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him."	"austen"
"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!"	"austen"
"It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace."	"austen"
"I am most seriously displeased."	"austen"
"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her."	"austen"
"And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject."	"austen"
"To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his."	"austen"
"After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer."	"austen"
"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts."	"austen"
"Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence."	"austen"
"She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success."	"austen"
"Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone."	"austen"
"It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."	"austen"
"He inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done."	"austen"
"Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."	"austen"
"When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted."	"austen"
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"	"austen"
"It is excellent newscapital newsand about a certain person we all like!"	"austen"
"Chapter 9 Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters."	"austen"
"But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general."	"austen"
"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire."	"austen"
"People do not die of little trifling colds."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence, and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself."	"austen"
"An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!"	"austen"
"And do you really love him quite well enough?"	"austen"
"A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility."	"austen"
"She was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle."	"austen"
"You have a very small park here, returned Lady Catherine after a short silence."	"austen"
"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow."	"austen"
"Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"	"austen"
"He had, to be sure, done much."	"austen"
"Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill."	"austen"
"But she is too much like her brothervery, very proud."	"austen"
"This was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part."	"austen"
"You know nothing of the matter."	"austen"
"she added, by far too much."	"austen"
"She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success."	"austen"
"This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards."	"austen"
"Chapter 50 Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him."	"austen"
"After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained: About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention."	"austen"
"The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh."	"austen"
"May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"	"austen"
"I can recall nothing worse."	"austen"
"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?"	"austen"
"He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while."	"austen"
"It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour."	"austen"

"Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus: My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained."	"austen"
"It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers."	"austen"
"But it is, returned she; for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."	"austen"
"Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."	"austen"
"I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"	"austen"
"Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with."	"austen"
"I thank you for explaining it so fully."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces."	"austen"
"But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible."	"austen"
"He has children of his own, and may have more."	"austen"
"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?"	"austen"
"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one."	"austen"
"A clear ten thousand per annum."	"austen"
"Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton?"	"austen"
"Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it."	"austen"
"However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."	"austen"
"We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."	"austen"
"It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know."	"austen"
"* * * * * In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme."	"austen"
"The latter was thinking only of his breakfast."	"austen"
"She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate."	"austen"
"She is quite a little creature."	"austen"
"and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?"	"austen"
"Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion."	"austen"
"They gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound."	"austen"
"I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her."	"austen"
"Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary."	"austen"
"He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane."	"austen"
"Pray write instantly, and let me understand itunless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."	"austen"
"Darcy was fixed in astonishment."	"austen"
"Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty."	"austen"
"I do indeed, replied Elizabeth, colouring."	"austen"
"This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make."	"austen"
"I shall not be able to keep youand so I warn you."	"austen"
"Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession."	"austen"
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure, said Mrs. Bennet, and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman."	"austen"
"I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read."	"austen"
"There was no want of discourse."	"austen"
"We have heard only twice."	"austen"
"said she, as she looked in her face."	"austen"
"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy."	"austen"
"Lizzy, said her father, I have given him my consent."	"austen"
"You may depend upon it, Madam, said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us."	"austen"
"My dear Charles, what do you mean?"	"austen"
"Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal."	"austen"
"After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour."	"austen"
"I thought I should have died."	"austen"
"If this be the case, he deserves you."	"austen"

"I pity, though I cannot help blaming her."	"austen"
"He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty."	"austen"
"Did he know of their intending to go off?"	"austen"
"Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless."	"austen"
"Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully."	"austen"
"He owns it himself without disguise."	"austen"
"Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected."	"austen"
"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October."	"austen"
"He seldom appeared really animated."	"austen"
"I want to know, said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham."	"austen"
"Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it."	"austen"
"said Mrs. Bennet more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own."	"austen"
"Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much."	"austen"
"These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay."	"austen"
"With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected."	"austen"
"Your sister I also watched."	"austen"
"At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer."	"austen"
"She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance."	"austen"
"I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good."	"austen"
"After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began: In vain I have struggled."	"austen"
"Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point."	"austen"
"It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling."	"austen"
"In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation."	"austen"
"By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration."	"austen"
"My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking."	"austen"
"She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse."	"austen"
"Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence."	"austen"
"Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings."	"austen"
"No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there."	"austen"
"It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."	"austen"
"Her nose wants characterthere is nothing marked in its lines."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshirepaid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure."	"austen"
"Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it."	"austen"
"The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown."	"austen"
"But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."	"austen"
"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do."	"austen"
"The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of."	"austen"
"His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him."	"austen"
"The letter was to this effect: MY DEAR LIZZY, I wish you joy."	"austen"
"When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgracewhen she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonagethe difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible."	"austen"
"He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there."	"austen"
"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began."	"austen"
"Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained."	"austen"
"Had not my feelings decided against youhad they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"	"austen"
"The tete-a-tete surprised them."	"austen"
"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere."	"austen"
"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason."	"austen"
"pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!"	"austen"
"Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves."	"austen"
"Come here, child, cried her father as she appeared."	"austen"
"They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?"	"austen"
"Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters."	"austen"
"Many staredmany smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man."	"austen"
"The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike."	"austen"
"I do not cough for my own amusement, replied Kitty fretfully."	"austen"
"You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."	"austen"
"Elizabeth could bear it no longer."	"austen"
"I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies."	"austen"
"Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill."	"austen"
"She related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain."	"austen"
"No thanks to his gallantry for that."	"austen"
"They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned."	"austen"
"She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side."	"austen"
"My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"	"austen"
"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly, said Lady Catherine; I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do."	"austen"
"I am sure I shall break mine, said Lydia."	"austen"
"She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished."	"austen"
"Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view."	"austen"
"but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption!"	"austen"
"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose, said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife."	"austen"
"Well, Lizzy, said Mrs. Bennet one day, what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane's?"	"austen"
"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved."	"austen"
"We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish."	"austen"
"At length however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends."	"austen"
"my dear Lydia, she cried, when shall we meet again?"	"austen"
"A little time, thereforeI shall certainly try to get the better."	"austen"
"I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written."	"austen"
"Then, showing her purchasesLook here, I have bought this bonnet."	"austen"
"I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, Well, Jane, who is it from?"	"austen"
"Chapter 17 Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself."	"austen"
"But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited."	"austen"
"Widely different was the effect of a second perusal."	"austen"
"But what does he say of the living?"	"austen"
"You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."	"austen"
"my dear brother, replied Mrs. Bennet, that is exactly what I could most wish for."	"austen"
"Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none."	"austen"
"And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out: Dear madam, do not go."	"austen"
"After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball."	"austen"
"Here you are in your own family."	"austen"
"There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake."	"austen"
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's."	"austen"
"Well, mamma, said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, and what do you think of my husband?"	"austen"
"The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid."	"austen"
"They were able to love each other even as well as they intended."	"austen"
"What a stroke was this for poor Jane!"	"austen"
"Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence."	"austen"
"His character is thereby complete."	"austen"
"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."	"austen"
"I confess, said he, that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings."	"austen"
"But I suppose you had no opportunity."	"austen"
"Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc."	"austen"
"It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing."	"austen"
"Their manners are not equal to his."	"austen"
"My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family."	"austen"
"Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's calling yesterday to thank me?"	"austen"
"Such a charming man!so handsome!"	"austen"
"Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman."	"austen"
"What will Wickham say?"	"austen"
"Oh, yes!of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt."	"austen"
"Except, thought Elizabeth, when she goes to Ramsgate."	"austen"
"Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her."	"austen"
"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary."	"austen"
"He has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."	"austen"
"And we mean to treat you all, added Lydia, but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."	"austen"
"Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory."	"austen"
"Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he wrote."	"austen"
"Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me."	"austen"
"I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word."	"austen"
"I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family."	"austen"
"You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves."	"austen"
"He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way."	"austen"
"Why will you think so?"	"austen"
"How shall we punish him for such a speech?"	"austen"
"If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement."	"austen"
"Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening."	"austen"
"His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile."	"austen"
"The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving."	"austen"
"She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over."	"austen"
"It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush."	"austen"
"But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here."	"austen"
"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."	"austen"
"I do not remember her name among the ladies at court."	"austen"
"I know them a little."	"austen"
"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it."	"austen"
"If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud."	"austen"
"It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed: Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her."	"austen"
"The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister."	"austen"
"What would she have said?"	"austen"
"I believe him to be Lady Catherine's nephew."	"austen"
"He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company."	"austen"
"it is just as he chooses."	"austen"
"His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year."	"austen"
"After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men."	"austen"
"Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself."	"austen"
"Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house."	"austen"
"Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time."	"austen"
"what is to become of us?"	"austen"
"The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above."	"austen"
"He is as fine a fellow, said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, as ever I saw."	"austen"
"She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place."	"austen"
"But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own."	"austen"
"Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."	"austen"
"I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."	"austen"
"how shall I bear so much happiness!"	"austen"
"How you must have hated me after that evening?"	"austen"
"He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister."	"austen"
"A most welcome negative followed the last questionand her alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme."	"austen"
"At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward."	"austen"
"Yes, yes, they must marry."	"austen"
"He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility."	"austen"
"I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him."	"austen"
"cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, it seems but a day or two since we first came!"	"austen"
"Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off."	"austen"
"If he fears me, why come hither?"	"austen"
"His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeableallowing something for fortune and figure."	"austen"
"Why must their marriage be private?"	"austen"
"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."	"austen"
"I leave it to yourself to determine, said Mr. Bennet."	"austen"
"Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved."	"austen"
"Nonsense, how can you talk so!"	"austen"
"And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection."	"austen"
"When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party."	"austen"
"She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her."	"austen"
"no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both."	"austen"
"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound."	"austen"
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."	"austen"
"Jane was beyond competition her favourite child."	"austen"
"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy had been at her sister's wedding."	"austen"
"But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem."	"austen"
"In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society."	"austen"
"At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself."	"austen"
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir."	"austen"
"She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greaterwhat shall I call it?"	"austen"
"First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room."	"austen"
"Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express."	"austen"
"The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter."	"austen"
"It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions."	"austen"
"If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor dishonesty I must call it."	"austen"
"Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister."	"austen"
"Little more than half a day's journey."	"austen"
"I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off."	"austen"
"I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women."	"austen"
"She did, indeed, Louisa."	"austen"
"Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him."	"austen"
"The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property."	"austen"
"Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend."	"austen"
"Their reception at home was most kind."	"austen"
"But let me advise you to think better of it."	"austen"
"I am not qualified to form one."	"austen"
"So, Lizzy, said he one day, your sister is crossed in love, I find."	"austen"
"When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane."	"austen"
"They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight."	"austen"
"Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week."	"austen"
"You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."	"austen"
"I believe she didand I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."	"austen"
"Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation."	"austen"
"Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her."	"austen"
"when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!"	"austen"
"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife."	"austen"
"But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered: No, no; stay where you are."	"austen"
"With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin."	"austen"
"And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman."	"austen"
"And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock."	"austen"
"There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day."	"austen"
"But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise."	"austen"
"From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed."	"austen"
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married, continued her mother, but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me."	"austen"
"My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way."	"austen"
"In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach."	"austen"
"He then said, I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly."	"austen"
"my dear, said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, it is not Lady Catherine."	"austen"
"She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did."	"austen"
"'My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England."	"austen"
"I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible."	"austen"
"She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others."	"austen"
"mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day?"	"austen"
"In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence."	"austen"
"Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment."	"austen"
"If she does not object to it, why should we?"	"austen"
"My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not."	"austen"
"It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."	"austen"
"If he no longer cares for me, why silent?"	"austen"
"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books."	"austen"
"The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from Londonhis five sisters and a cousin."	"austen"
"The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house."	"austen"
"Chapter 53 Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet."	"austen"
"Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit."	"austen"
"In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before."	"austen"
"Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much."	"austen"
"Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!"	"austen"
"Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness."	"austen"
"They had frequently been staying with her in town."	"austen"
"It now first struck her, that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors."	"austen"
"and to see dear Wickham too!"	"austen"
"The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone."	"austen"
"She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins made his declaration in form."	"austen"
"It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon."	"austen"
"You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."	"austen"
"But I knew I should persuade you at last."	"austen"
"But now it comes out: 'My motive for cautioning you is as follows."	"austen"
"I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone."	"austen"
"But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage."	"austen"
"I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me."	"austen"
"They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry."	"austen"
"You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous."	"austen"
"The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence."	"austen"
"The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out."	"austen"
"It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations."	"austen"
"What are you telling Miss Bennet?"	"austen"
"She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions."	"austen"
"I hope you have destroyed the letter."	"austen"
"She is a great deal too ill to be moved."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity."	"austen"
"With assumed tranquillity he then replied: I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success."	"austen"
"But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him."	"austen"
"To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected."	"austen"
"What could your ladyship propose by it?"	"austen"
"He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her."	"austen"
"Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do."	"austen"
"Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement."	"austen"
"Make haste, make haste."	"austen"
"But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation."	"austen"
"Not these two or three years, perhaps."	"austen"
"Sir William had been delighted with him."	"austen"
"The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family."	"austen"
"How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves."	"austen"
"I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony."	"austen"
"Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear."	"austen"
"dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain."	"austen"
"Yesif Darcy does not put it off again."	"austen"
"She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before."	"austen"
"As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room."	"austen"
"I am exceedingly gratified, said Bingley, by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said: This walk is not wide enough for our party."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer."	"austen"
"He studies too much for words of four syllables."	"austen"
"Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."	"austen"
"You must be surprised, very much surprisedso lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you."	"austen"
"How is such a man to be worked on?"	"austen"
"Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her."	"austen"
"How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!"	"austen"
"Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former."	"austen"
"She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage."	"austen"
"I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage."	"austen"
"The officers may not be so pleasant in General 's regiment."	"austen"
"Very welland this offer of marriage you have refused?"	"austen"
"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns, said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour."	"austen"
"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."	"austen"
"Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?"	"austen"
"Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never."	"austen"
"He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy."	"austen"
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming, said her uncle."	"austen"
"Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn."	"austen"
"The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post."	"austen"
"But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled."	"austen"
"I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."	"austen"
"You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone."	"austen"
"One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."	"austen"
"In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation."	"austen"
"They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South."	"austen"
"They are my old friends."	"austen"
"Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts."	"austen"
"She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.Yours, etc., E. GARDINER."	"austen"
"said he, taking the letter from his pocket."	"austen"
"I had not believed it possible."	"austen"
"When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietorwhen she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room."	"austen"
"Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other."	"austen"
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections."	"austen"
"It was a rational scheme, to be sure!"	"austen"
"Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart."	"austen"
"On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion."	"austen"
"Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said: I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit."	"austen"
"They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother."	"austen"
"When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister."	"austen"
"Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, I have never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."	"austen"
"After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying: I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!"	"austen"
"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you."	"austen"
"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him."	"austen"
"You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt."	"austen"
"Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it."	"austen"
"The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share."	"austen"
"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas, she added in a melancholy tone, for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me."	"austen"
"said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam."	"austen"
"That tall, proud man."	"austen"
"Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh."	"austen"
"Your first position is false."	"austen"
"The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred."	"austen"
"And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false."	"austen"
"but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea."	"austen"
"It was drawn at the same time as the otherabout eight years ago."	"austen"
"But it is allall too late now."	"austen"
"What is there of good to be expected?"	"austen"
"These were the contents: MY DEAR HARRIET, You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed."	"austen"
"I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished."	"austen"
"She had very little notice from any but him."	"austen"
"She is grown so brown and coarse!"	"austen"
"What is your opinion?"	"austen"
"But however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so."	"austen"
"His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad."	"austen"
"These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not."	"austen"
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society, he added, which was my chief inducement to enter the shire."	"austen"
"I thought him very sly;he hardly ever mentioned your name."	"austen"
"If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this."	"austen"
"I am the less surprised at what has happened, replied Sir William, from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire."	"austen"
"My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable."	"austen"
"Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them."	"austen"
"Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly."	"austen"
"But you see that Jane, said her aunt, does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt."	"austen"
"Do you suppose them to be in London?"	"austen"
"His words seemed to imply it."	"austen"
"She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses."	"austen"
"The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly."	"austen"
"Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance."	"austen"
"Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on."	"austen"
"You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody."	"austen"
"but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable."	"austen"
"You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you."	"austen"
"I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference."	"austen"
"It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned."	"austen"
"I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if you dare."	"austen"
"It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two."	"austen"
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father."	"austen"
"ThereI have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable."	"austen"
"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate."	"austen"
"Yesthat is what makes it amusing."	"austen"
"And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away."	"austen"
"He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm."	"austen"
"I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do."	"austen"
"He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister."	"austen"
"Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabethand it was soon donedone while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire."	"austen"
"He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend."	"austen"
"As the day of his arrival drew near, I begin to be sorry that he comes at all, said Jane to her sister."	"austen"
"I am sure there is not on his."	"austen"
"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself?"	"austen"
"She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther."	"austen"
"Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding."	"austen"
"We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."	"austen"
"How odious I should think them!"	"austen"
"I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."	"austen"
"She is not such a simpleton."	"austen"
"In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin."	"austen"
"But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came."	"austen"
"She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak."	"austen"
"You write uncommonly fast."	"austen"
"That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!"	"austen"
"Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon."	"austen"
"The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described."	"austen"
"Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do."	"austen"
"Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley: I can guess the subject of your reverie."	"austen"
"Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"	"austen"
"When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten."	"austen"
"I hope, added Mrs. Gardiner, that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her."	"austen"
"You have done all this!"	"austen"
"The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd."	"austen"
"They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities."	"austen"
"In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger."	"austen"
"She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter."	"austen"
"I will have no reserves from you."	"austen"
"Chapter 23 Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her engagement to the family."	"austen"
"Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head."	"austen"
"The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each."	"austen"
"On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former."	"austen"
"I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude."	"austen"
"But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it."	"austen"
"You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."	"austen"
"An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all."	"austen"
"The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits."	"austen"
"I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy."	"austen"
"Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring."	"austen"
"Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."	"austen"
"A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away."	"austen"
"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time."	"austen"
"I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this."	"austen"
"His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself."	"austen"
"And when you have given your ball, she added, I shall insist on their giving one also."	"austen"
"This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least."	"austen"
"Our poor mother is sadly grieved."	"austen"
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you, said he, when she had finished her speech."	"austen"
"As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner: You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither."	"austen"
"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea."	"austen"
"Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House."	"austen"
"That is his notion of Christian forgiveness!"	"austen"
"Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head."	"austen"
"Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before."	"austen"
"But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done."	"austen"
"My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking."	"austen"
"In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said: Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room."	"austen"
"Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room."	"austen"
"At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything."	"austen"
"There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town."	"austen"
"This will not do, said Elizabeth; you never will be able to make both of them good for anything."	"austen"
"He has the promise of an ensigncy in General 's regiment, now quartered in the North."	"austen"
"After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family."	"austen"
"But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other."	"austen"
"But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."	"austen"
"where, where is my uncle?"	"austen"
"And then we were so merry all the way home!"	"austen"
"They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her: So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!"	"austen"
"She is my youngest girl but one."	"austen"
"Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter."	"austen"
"Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented."	"austen"
"On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, Very well, if it must be so, it must."	"austen"
"Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing."	"austen"
"At that moment, she cared for no other."	"austen"
"And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight."	"austen"
"I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."	"austen"
"I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal."	"austen"
"I have not been accustomed to such language as this."	"austen"
"To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever."	"austen"
"Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance."	"austen"
"And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library."	"austen"
"I have no right to give my opinion, said Wickham, as to his being agreeable or otherwise."	"austen"
"He is also handsome, replied Elizabeth, which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can."	"austen"
"With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning."	"austen"
"I shall go distracted."	"austen"
"But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded."	"austen"
"If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents."	"austen"
"The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained."	"austen"
"Have you any other objection, said Elizabeth, than your belief of my indifference?"	"austen"
"I wish I could call her amiable."	"austen"
"They were hopeless of remedy."	"austen"
"Jane, cried Elizabeth, was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"	"austen"
"And what sort of table do they keep?"	"austen"
"What is it you are talking of?"	"austen"
"She was dying to know what could be his meaning?and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?"	"austen"
"As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane."	"austen"
"who could have done less for her?"	"austen"
"As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."	"austen"
"observed Mrs. Bennet."	"austen"
"Thank you, said Lydia, for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."	"austen"
"The officers will find women better worth their notice."	"austen"
"In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief."	"austen"
"If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach."	"austen"
"Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship."	"austen"
"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had."	"austen"
"But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair."	"austen"
"No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation."	"austen"
"He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him."	"austen"
"He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character."	"austen"
"The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport."	"austen"
"I do not know when I have been more shocked, said she."	"austen"
"Nothing could be more delightful!"	"austen"
"Even Elizabeth began to fearnot that Bingley was indifferentbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away."	"austen"
"How humiliating is this discovery!"	"austen"
"Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not."	"austen"
"'Tis as good as a Lord!"	"austen"
"I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours."	"austen"
"Women fancy admiration means more than it does."	"austen"
"Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly; and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family."	"austen"
"In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind."	"austen"
"How merry we shall be together when we meet!"	"austen"
"They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together."	"austen"
"Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants."	"austen"
"It is useless to talk of it."	"austen"
"He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me."	"austen"
"Three daughters married!"	"austen"
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me."	"austen"
"But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for herfor a woman who had already refused himas able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham."	"austen"
"Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice, and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer to the calumnies (for so they called them) that were circulated about him."	"wilde"
"Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond of you?"	"wilde"
"My dear Basil, how do I know?"	"wilde"
"When we meet,we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go down to the duke's,we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces."	"wilde"
"I felt I had done wrong."	"wilde"
"Another cope was of green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves, from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which were picked out with silver thread and colored crystals."	"wilde"
"Sibyl is the only thing I care about."	"wilde"
"Then she had disappointed him."	"wilde"
"For there is such a little time that your youth will last,such a little time."	"wilde"
"In the country, Harry."	"wilde"
"The sodden eyes had kept something of the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet passed entirely away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat."	"wilde"
"They waited for that."	"wilde"
"Some one has killed herself for love of you."	"wilde"
"It is an interesting question, said Lord Henry, who found an exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad's unconscious egotism,an extremely interesting question."	"wilde"
"His life with her would be beautiful and pure."	"wilde"
"Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands."	"wilde"
"A white-smocked carter offered him some cherries."	"wilde"
"I don't feel that, Lord Henry."	"wilde"
"It had more expression than I had ever heard from it before."	"wilde"
"As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a light French breakfast, that had been laid out for him on a small round table close to an open window."	"wilde"
"She had often mimicked death on the stage, and at last Death himself had touched her, and brought her with him."	"wilde"
"It was not a new world, but rather a new chaos, that it created in us."	"wilde"
"That was horrible in its cruelty."	"wilde"
"And he wiped his shiny forehead."	"wilde"
"He had changed, too,was strangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music of any passionate character, and would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in which to practise."	"wilde"
"I see you are laughing."	"wilde"
"Lord Henry looked across the table."	"wilde"
"The mellow November sun was streaming into the room."	"wilde"
"She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain."	"wilde"
"ThenBut I don't know how to explain it to you."	"wilde"
"Let us go, Basil, said Lord Henry, with a strange tenderness in his voice; and the two young men passed out together."	"wilde"
"The man bowed and retired."	"wilde"
"Were his own actions merely the dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize?"	"wilde"
"He got up from his chair, and drew a large screen right in front of the portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it."	"wilde"
"Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will."	"wilde"
"What about your country-house, and the life that is led there?"	"wilde"
"Basil, I am tired of standing, cried Dorian Gray, suddenly."	"wilde"
"I will never think of you."	"wilde"
"He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the portrait."	"wilde"
"Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had the true refinement and perfect delicacy that come only from strength."	"wilde"
"A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man."	"wilde"
"He was bareheaded, and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads."	"wilde"
"Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it."	"wilde"
"He was trembling all over."	"wilde"
"What was he doing there?"	"wilde"
"Some red star had come too close to the earth."	"wilde"
"What a place to find one's divinity in!"	"wilde"
"I will show you the way, Mr. Ashton, if you will kindly follow me."	"wilde"
"He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away to catch his train."	"wilde"
"He seemed determined to bring me behind, so I consented."	"wilde"
"Shall I leave the things here, sir?"	"wilde"
"Then had come Lord Henry, with his strange panegyric on youth, his terrible warning of its brevity."	"wilde"
"The sky was bright blue, and there was a genial warmth in the air."	"wilde"
"You should have come on there."	"wilde"
"Out of its secret hiding-place had crept his Soul, and Desire had come to meet it on the way."	"wilde"
"Every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him, as he looked round."	"wilde"
"Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry, said Hallward, smiling."	"wilde"
"It's not fit for you to see, Master Dorian."	"wilde"
"Them foreigners doesn't understand jam, Master Dorian."	"wilde"
"As he looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there."	"wilde"
"The moment she touched actual life, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away."	"wilde"
"Rouge and esprit used to go together."	"wilde"
"There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make one almost enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of revery."	"wilde"
"You don't inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come from."	"wilde"

"That is entirely due to me, broke in Lord Henry."	"wilde"

"Your picture has taught me that."	"wilde"
"The fascination that she had exercised over him would return."	"wilde"
"If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honor I will never speak to you again as long as I live."	"wilde"
"It was Basil Hallward."	"wilde"
"I am going, he said at last, in his calm, clear voice."	"wilde"
"Art sounds better, doesn't it?"	"wilde"
"I won't tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it."	"wilde"
"And the roses are not less lovely for all that."	"wilde"
"I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming people do."	"wilde"
"After a few moments he said to him, Have you really a very bad influence, Lord Henry?"	"wilde"
"I know what conscience is, to begin with."	"wilde"
"The persons are here, monsieur."	"wilde"

"I have promised to dine at White's, but it is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire and say that I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement."	"wilde"
"I am putting it into practice, as I do everything you say."	"wilde"
"A terrible load to carry, murmured Dorian, as he unlocked the door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men."	"wilde"
"You and I are friends, Basil, and we must always remain so."	"wilde"
"cried Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror."	"wilde"
"As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul."	"wilde"
"In the present case, what is it that has really happened?"	"wilde"
"Yes, it had been conscience."	"wilde"
"She will never come to life again now, murmured the lad, burying his face in his hands."	"wilde"
"Impossible, my dear boy!"	"wilde"

"Once, in boyish mockery of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips that now smiled so cruelly at him."	"wilde"
"Then he straightened himself up, and walked over to the fireplace, and stood there, looking at the burning logs with their frost-like ashes and their throbbing cores of flame."	"wilde"
"Why should he be murdered?"	"wilde"
"He would become ignoble, hideous, and uncouth."	"wilde"

"Let me think, or, rather, let me try not to think."	"wilde"
"I suffered immensely, then it passed away."	"wilde"
"I won't trouble you any more now."	"wilde"
"At last the door opened, and his servant entered."	"wilde"
"Basil, said the lad, going over to him, and putting his hand on his shoulder, you have come too late."	"wilde"
"I suppose it would, muttered the lad, walking up and down the room, and looking horribly pale."	"wilde"
"Then he rang the bell, and gave it to his valet, with orders to return as soon as possible, and to bring the things with him."	"wilde"
"Had the portrait really changed?"	"wilde"
"He was really very devoted to me, and seemed quite sorry when he went away."	"wilde"
"And, yet, what did it matter?"	"wilde"
"When she leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines, Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say, It lightens."	"wilde"
"I don't know what to say."	"wilde"
"We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets."	"wilde"
"And much less than a friend."	"wilde"
"He glanced wildly around."	"wilde"
"What did you mean by that?"	"wilde"
"You have come to the wrong man."	"wilde"
"murmured Dorian Gray, with his eyes still fixed upon his own portrait."	"wilde"
"I do it on principle."	"wilde"
"During the three terrible hours that the play had lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture."	"wilde"
"The paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them."	"wilde"
"He gives you good advice, I suppose."	"wilde"
"A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted image of himself, came over him."	"wilde"
"You laugh, but I tell you she has genius."	"wilde"
"And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little child."	"wilde"
"How well you know me!"	"wilde"
"Basil, this is quite wonderful!"	"wilde"
"They can sit quietly and gape at the play."	"wilde"
"What do you think has happened to Basil?"	"wilde"
"You won't have to read long."	"wilde"
"The world belongs to you for a season."	"wilde"
"He felt that the man must be got rid of at once."	"wilde"
"You are certainly my best friend."	"wilde"
"He winced, and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory Cupids, that Lord Henry had given him, he glanced hurriedly into it."	"wilde"
"What I want you to do is simply what you have often done before."	"wilde"
"You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you."	"wilde"
"I feel too tired to eat anything."	"wilde"
"That had stirred him at the time, and now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full reality of the description flashed across him."	"wilde"
"It was the portrait that had done everything."	"wilde"
"Oh, Harry, I can't bear it!"	"wilde"
"How different an actress is!"	"wilde"
"They are both simply forms of imitation, murmured Lord Henry."	"wilde"
"But the strange expression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be more intensified even."	"wilde"
"But it will never alter, said Hallward."	"wilde"
"We are punished for our refusals."	"wilde"
"I don't care what you say to me, I know I was right in acting as I did."	"wilde"
"cried the original of the portrait, running across to him."	"wilde"
"Why did you paint it?"	"wilde"
"I want you to get rid of the dreadful people you associate with."	"wilde"
"Was the face on the canvas viler than before?"	"wilde"
"That is one of your aphorisms."	"wilde"
"There were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins."	"wilde"
"One hour and a quarter, monsieur."	"wilde"
"He knew it, and he felt as if his blood had changed from fire to sluggish ice in a moment."	"wilde"
"Campbell was always either at Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square."	"wilde"
"They always want a sixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over they propose to continue it."	"wilde"
"There was neither real sorrow in it nor real joy."	"wilde"
"And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools!"	"wilde"
"I want to learn them."	"wilde"
"I believe he was quite right there."	"wilde"
"They ultimately found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing-room."	"wilde"
"Something dreadful about marriage."	"wilde"
"There, of course, I stumbled against Lady Brandon."	"wilde"
"He looked round, and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward."	"wilde"
"Oh, Harry, how I loved her once!"	"wilde"
"There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry,too much of myself!"	"wilde"
"You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world."	"wilde"
"It was terribly pathetic."	"wilde"
"His nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of scarlet flame."	"wilde"
"I am only ten years older than you are, and I am wrinkled, and bald, and yellow."	"wilde"
"They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever."	"wilde"
"They were horribly disappointed."	"wilde"
"Not look at my own work!"	"wilde"
"Of course I never let you know anything about this."	"wilde"
"The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view of tone it was absolutely false."	"wilde"
"You have chattered enough about corruption."	"wilde"
"But the reason was of no importance."	"wilde"
"It is quite true that I have worshipped you with far more romance of feeling than a man usually gives to a friend."	"wilde"
"You can't feel what I feel."	"wilde"
"Hallward turned perfectly pale, and a curious look flashed for a moment into his eyes, and then passed away, leaving them dull."	"wilde"
"A cry of pain rose from the lad's lips, and he leaped to his feet, tearing his hands away from Lord Henry's grasp."	"wilde"
"I at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair, horridly freckled, and tramping about on huge feet."	"wilde"
"What could he do then?"	"wilde"
"Or, perhaps, all these?"	"wilde"
"The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old men are."	"wilde"
"If in some hideous dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject."	"wilde"
"No, Harry, answered Hallward, giving his hat and coat to the bowing waiter."	"wilde"
"Well, after I had been in the room about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious Academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me."	"wilde"
"Hallward turned pale, and caught his hand."	"wilde"
"Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my life."	"wilde"
"I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act."	"wilde"
"I should like to be somebody else."	"wilde"
"You may fancy yourself safe, and think yourself strong."	"wilde"
"I can't bear the idea of my soul being hideous."	"wilde"
"A long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge jade-green piles of vegetables."	"wilde"
"CHAPTER II As they entered they saw Dorian Gray."	"wilde"
"In art, as in politics, les grand pères ont toujours tort."	"wilde"
"It has had that excellent effect, among others."	"wilde"
"And yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my life."	"wilde"
"Don't change, Dorian; at any rate, don't change to me."	"wilde"
"Those words mean nothing to me now."	"wilde"
"I have the greatest contempt for optimism."	"wilde"
"He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken; the long clarin of the Mexicans, into which the performer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the harsh turé of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in trees, and that can be heard, it is said, at a distance of three leagues; the teponaztli, that has two vibrating tongues of wood, and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the yotl-bells of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a description."	"wilde"
"We have lost the abstract sense of beauty."	"wilde"
"They are quite obvious."	"wilde"
"Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one of all."	"wilde"
"Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a beer-barrel."	"wilde"
"He drew them away, and a shudder ran through him."	"wilde"
"He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him."	"wilde"
"You are quite perfect."	"wilde"
"This bud of love by summer's ripening breath May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet, she spoke the words as if they conveyed no meaning to her."	"wilde"
"The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion,these are the two things that govern us."	"wilde"
"It seemed to him that he had been walking in fire."	"wilde"
"My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly, he said.Mr."	"wilde"
"I could not bear your doing either of those two things."	"wilde"
"I hope the girl is good, Harry."	"wilde"
"You are really wonderful, Dorian."	"wilde"
"I hope it is not about myself."	"wilde"
"Lord Henry smiled, and, leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from the grass, and examined it."	"wilde"
"No: I am going to be out of England for six months."	"wilde"
"he cried, don't talk like that."	"wilde"
"He would be a wonderful study."	"wilde"
"He did not know what to do, or what to think."	"wilde"
"The orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the coronation of the Virgin was figured in colored silks upon the hood."	"wilde"
"In the left-hand corner was his own name, traced in long letters of bright vermilion."	"wilde"
"As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry's arm."	"wilde"
"At what particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian?"	"wilde"
"One evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen."	"wilde"
"I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you."	"wilde"
"You can't approve of it, really."	"wilde"
"How clear, and vivid, and cruel!"	"wilde"
"He stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him."	"wilde"
"He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked extraordinarily handsome."	"wilde"
"It is dreadful, from one point of view, but it was not your fault."	"wilde"
"Basil had been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret."	"wilde"
"Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel every sign of evil passion from the face."	"wilde"
"And yet the thing would still live on."	"wilde"
"When I close my eyes, I hear them, and each of them says something different."	"wilde"
"No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful things in my life."	"wilde"
"If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay."	"wilde"
"Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's heart beating, and he wondered what was coming."	"wilde"
"It seems to me curious now that they should ever be found together."	"wilde"
"Where were you yesterday?"	"wilde"
"And you are awfully unjust, Basil."	"wilde"
"I believe that women appreciate cruelty more than anything else."	"wilde"
"In fact, I don't want any white ones."	"wilde"
"Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots, and laughing."	"wilde"
"We are both punished."	"wilde"
"But what a lack of taste she showed!"	"wilde"
"The evening darkened in the room."	"wilde"
"The presence of a third person in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage."	"wilde"
"It was like a placid mask of servility."	"wilde"
"Besides, women were better suited to bear sorrow than men."	"wilde"
"Even as a beginning, it is poor."	"wilde"
"What are you without your art?"	"wilde"
"Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment."	"wilde"
"I read of it quite by chance in a late edition of the Globe, that I picked up at the club."	"wilde"
"But don't ask me to read anything to-night."	"wilde"
"I felt all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not express it to myself."	"wilde"
"It has not marred you."	"wilde"
"I was very fond of her."	"wilde"
"She has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reed-like throat."	"wilde"
"The windows yielded easily: the bolts were old."	"wilde"
"The horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it."	"wilde"
"An exclamation of horror broke from Hallward's lips as he saw in the dim light the hideous thing on the canvas leering at him."	"wilde"
"That is a great advantage: don't you think so, Mr. Gray?"	"wilde"
"You and he were inseparable."	"wilde"
"Dorian Gray had not killed her."	"wilde"
"It was dank with clammy sweat."	"wilde"
"I will stay with the real Dorian, he said, sadly."	"wilde"
"Nothing could alter that."	"wilde"
"What have I to do with the puppets of a play?"	"wilde"
"We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian, answered Lord Henry, shaking him by the hand."	"wilde"
"Then, after his valet had reminded him several times of the lateness of the hour, he got up, and, going into the next room, placed the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his bedside, and began to dress for dinner."	"wilde"
"She knew nothing, but she had everything that he had lost."	"wilde"
"He stood there motionless, and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words."	"wilde"
"But you said it was a matter of life and death."	"wilde"
"But what if, by some fate or deadlier chance, other eyes than his spied behind, and saw the horrible change?"	"wilde"
"Sometimes, however, a tragedy that has artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives."	"wilde"
"Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me."	"wilde"
"It seemed to him that as the man left the room he peered in the direction of the screen."	"wilde"
"The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid."	"wilde"
"Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I will be in in a few moments."	"wilde"
"Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to the world Basil Hallward's masterpiece."	"wilde"
"Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn't it?"	"wilde"
"And you must not say these extravagant things to me."	"wilde"
"When he is missed, there must be no trace of him found here."	"wilde"
"Had he gone to his aunt's, he would have been sure to meet Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about the housing of the poor, and the necessity for model lodging-houses."	"wilde"
"And unselfish people are colorless."	"wilde"
"Surely his prayer had not been answered?"	"wilde"
"Why inquire too closely into it?"	"wilde"
"The lad started and drew back."	"wilde"
"You have not realized how I have developed."	"wilde"
"I am told things that it seems impossible to doubt."	"wilde"
"Did you really see it?"	"wilde"
"He felt that Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the past."	"wilde"
"Dorian, Dorian, your reputation is infamous."	"wilde"
"But the future was inevitable."	"wilde"
"He could not run such a risk of discovery again."	"wilde"
"Hallward was silent and preoccupied."	"wilde"
"Years ago, when I was a boy, said Dorian Gray, you met me, devoted yourself to me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my good looks."	"wilde"
"I am so sorry I didn't act well."	"wilde"
"Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed."	"wilde"
"The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world."	"wilde"
"The world had looked upon him as infamous."	"wilde"
"Basil, cried Dorian Gray, if Lord Henry goes I shall go too."	"wilde"
"The expression looked different."	"wilde"
"They are forced to have more than one life."	"wilde"
"She put her hand upon his arm, and looked into his eyes."	"wilde"
"Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks."	"wilde"
"had a coat, valued at thirty thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies."	"wilde"
"But you were simple, natural, and affectionate then."	"wilde"
"I would have made you famous, splendid, magnificent."	"wilde"
"Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile."	"wilde"
"Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had told his own sin."	"wilde"
"Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head."	"wilde"
"I believe he married Lady Ashton's maid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker."	"wilde"
"And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation."	"wilde"
"Ah, then, said Lord Henry, rising to go,then, my dear Dorian, you would have to fight for your victories."	"wilde"
"My God, Harry, how I worship her!"	"wilde"
"Your friend Lord Henry Wotton can't have taught you much about psychology, whatever else he has taught you."	"wilde"
"The Grosvenor is the only place."	"wilde"
"What should they know of love?"	"wilde"
"One he read several times over, and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face."	"wilde"
"Laughter is not a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is the best ending for one, said Lord Henry, plucking another daisy."	"wilde"
"His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that he affected from time to time, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of his graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies."	"wilde"
"Suddenly I determined to leave her as flower-like as I had found her."	"wilde"
"If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat."	"wilde"
"I think, from his blank look of amazement, that he thought I had taken too much champagne, or something."	"wilde"
"I knew that if I spoke to Dorian I would become absolutely devoted to him, and that I ought not to speak to him."	"wilde"
"How pleasant it was in the garden!"	"wilde"
"That makes no matter."	"wilde"
"And how strange it was that, instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend!"	"wilde"
"The boyish beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and many others besides him, seemed never to leave him."	"wilde"
"They make one believe in the reality of the things that shallow, fashionable people play with, such as romance, passion, and love."	"wilde"
"He placed his foot on it and put it out."	"wilde"
"When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure."	"wilde"
"said the boy, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings, and shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn."	"wilde"
"Dorian, if I told you, you might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me."	"wilde"
"I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis, he said, stepping in; but I had forgotten my latch-key."	"wilde"
"And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals!"	"wilde"
"Courage has gone out of our race."	"wilde"
"In fact, I was on my way to the club to look for you, when I met you."	"wilde"
"I have promised to drive with the duchess.Good-by, Mr. Gray.Good-by, Harry."	"wilde"
"And, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in."	"wilde"
"The apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing."	"wilde"
"Lord Henry peered through his opera-glass, murmuring, Charming!"	"wilde"
"He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and dragged the purple hanging from the portrait."	"wilde"
"Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased, and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions."	"wilde"
"I should not be sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced."	"wilde"
"The dead man was still sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now."	"wilde"
"I don't wish to be unkind, but I can't see you again."	"wilde"
"Basil Hallward's compliments had seemed to him to be merely the charming exaggerations of friendship."	"wilde"
"I believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the nineteenth-century standard of immortality."	"wilde"
"I shall not inform upon you."	"wilde"
"My dear fellow, I am not quite serious."	"wilde"
"You have changed, of course, but not in appearance."	"wilde"
"I understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl."	"wilde"
"You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray,far too charming."	"wilde"
"Country-people have no opportunity of being either, so they stagnate."	"wilde"
"While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the door, and his valet entered, and reminded him it was time to dress for dinner."	"wilde"
"Then I must do it myself, said the young man; and he tore the curtain from its rod, and flung it on the ground."	"wilde"
"I remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful night when we first dined together, about the search for beauty being the poisonous secret of life."	"wilde"
"He shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the picture in sickened horror."	"wilde"
"In the mystic offices to which these things were put there was something that quickened his imagination."	"wilde"
"But you mustn't talk about not meeting me again, or anything of that kind."	"wilde"
"A curious instinct of terror came over me."	"wilde"
"He turned on his heel, and left the room."	"wilde"
"Imogen is waiting for me."	"wilde"
"And yet Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good boy, said Hallward, deep in his work, and conscious only that a look had come into the lad's face that he had never seen there before."	"wilde"
"Draw that curtain back, and you will see mine."	"wilde"
"Harry spends his days in saying what is incredible, and his evenings in doing what is improbable."	"wilde"
"Yes: I don't suppose you will object to that."	"wilde"
"Was he really to confess?"	"wilde"
"Remembered what, Harry?"	"wilde"
"He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there."	"wilde"
"And this was certainly true."	"wilde"
"Is that very vain of me?"	"wilde"
"You don't imagine I let him arrange my room for me?"	"wilde"
"Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you understand now what it all means?"	"wilde"
"Yes, Basil could have saved him."	"wilde"
"Then he remembered the lamp."	"wilde"
"The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms."	"wilde"
"I get hungry for her presence; and when I think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I am filled with awe."	"wilde"
"Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that."	"wilde"
"You have got Harry, said Hallward, sadly."	"wilde"
"I will have to go home and get some things from the laboratory."	"wilde"
"It was curious my not wanting to know her, wasn't it?"	"wilde"
"Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex."	"wilde"
"Nothing seems to us changed."	"wilde"
"It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives reality to things."	"wilde"
"Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her child-like look and winsome fanciful ways and shy tremulous grace."	"wilde"
"Why had he not known it?"	"wilde"
"I shall see you before nine-thirty, I hope."	"wilde"
"Basil would have helped him to resist Lord Henry's influence, and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament."	"wilde"
"A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up, and the curtain rose on the third act."	"wilde"
"The wind had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock's tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes."	"wilde"
"But I certainly will not run away, now that you have asked me to stop."	"wilde"
"Mind, Harry, I trust you."	"wilde"
"It is quite true, Dorian, said Lord Henry, gravely."	"wilde"
"She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio, Basil."	"wilde"
"He opened the door a little wider, and walked quickly in, with half-closed eyes and averted head, determined that he would not look even once upon the dead man."	"wilde"
"The picture itself,that was evidence."	"wilde"
"Now, I don't know what has come over you."	"wilde"
"I am inclined to think that I never was engaged."	"wilde"
"We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbor with those virtues that are likely to benefit ourselves."	"wilde"
"There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful."	"wilde"
"And the mind of the thoroughly well informed man is a dreadful thing."	"wilde"
"Half the charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that no one knew who he was."	"wilde"
"His romantic olive-colored face and worn expression interested him."	"wilde"
"My father destined me for the army."	"wilde"
"We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us."	"wilde"
"asked the elder of the two gentlemen."	"wilde"
"He was seated at the piano, with his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann's Forest Scenes."	"wilde"
"As he reached the door he hesitated for a moment, as if he had something more to say."	"wilde"
"I thought her shallow."	"wilde"
"How different Sibyl was!"	"wilde"
"Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know, cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the garden together, and for a time they did not speak."	"wilde"
"The common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike."	"wilde"
"He had told her once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him, and told him that wicked people were always very old and very ugly."	"wilde"
"He spoke with slow deliberation."	"wilde"
"What if Alan Campbell should be out of England?"	"wilde"
"Why I was so bad to-night."	"wilde"
"I remember her bringing me up to a most truculent and red-faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room, something like 'Sir Humpty Dumptyyou knowAfghan frontierRussian intrigues: very successful manwife killed by an elephantquite inconsolablewants to marry a beautiful American widoweverybody does nowadayshates Mr. Gladstonebut very much interested in beetles: ask him what he thinks of Schouvaloff.'"	"wilde"
"don't you see that accursed thing leering at us?"	"wilde"
"But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same."	"wilde"
"You should have gone away when I asked you."	"wilde"
"He put on his fur coat and hat, and went out into the hall."	"wilde"
"I want the Dorian Gray I used to know."	"wilde"
"I'll take it for you."	"wilde"

"wilde"
"He would examine with minute care, and often with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age."	"wilde"

"Dorian shook his head."	"wilde"

"Music had troubled him many times."	"wilde"

"In a mad moment, that I don't know, even now, whether I regret or not, I made a wish."	"wilde"
"Well, after a few days the portrait left my studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had said anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-looking and that I could paint."	"wilde"
"Or had his choice already been made?"	"wilde"
"It seems silly of the French, doesn't it?"	"wilde"
"Sin is the only color-element left in modern life."	"wilde"
"I wanted to have you all to myself."	"wilde"
"He longed to see the curious table-napkins wrought for Elagabalus, on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast; the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus, and were figured with lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters,all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature; and the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning Madame, je suis tout joyeux, the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, and each note, a square shape in those days, formed with four pearls."

"He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of ennui, and became a confirmed misanthrope."	"wilde"
"He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing."	"wilde"
"If you wish me never to look at your picture again, I am content."	"wilde"
"Or was that only his fancy?"	"wilde"

"Pleasanter for you, I am afraid, murmured Hallward, regretfully."	"wilde"

"Then you can do what you like with yourself."	"wilde"
"But a chance tone of color in a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings strange memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to play,I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that our lives depend."

"How curious it all seemed!"	"wilde"
"murmured Dorian, sipping some pale-yellow wine from a delicate gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass, and looking dreadfully bored."	"wilde"

"cried Dorian, leaping to his feet."	"wilde"
"What is it all about?"	"wilde"
"I have promised to meet a man at the Orleans.Good-by, Mr. Gray."	"wilde"
"It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray to be the true object, or among the true objects, of life; and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their color and satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardor of temperament, and that indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition of it."

"Professor Challenger's reasons for secrecy may be valid or not, but we had no choice but to adopt them, for he was prepared to abandon the whole expedition rather than modify the conditions upon which he would guide us."	"doyle"

"After tripping and stumbling over these lumps of decay, I came suddenly against something hard, and I found that an upright post was firmly fixed in the center of the hollow."	"doyle"
"In their excitement they had unconsciously seized each other by the hand, and stood like two little children in the presence of a marvel, Challenger's cheeks bunched up into a seraphic smile, and Summerlee's sardonic face softening for the moment into wonder and reverence."	"doyle"
"It was the tread of some animalthe rhythm of soft but heavy pads placed cautiously upon the ground."	"doyle"
"I have said before that Lord John Roxton was a South Americomaniac."	"doyle"

"They were big fellows, as big as a man and a deal stronger."	"doyle"
"It is surely an Assai palm, said Summerlee."	"doyle"
"That hissing pant, as regular and full-volumed as the exhaust of an engine, spoke of a monstrous organism."	"doyle"
"Professor Challenger answered that Mr. Summerlee appeared to be confusing the Amazon with the Thames; that it was in reality a somewhat larger river; that Mr. Summerlee might be interested to know that with the Orinoco, which communicated with it, some fifty thousand miles of country were opened up, and that in so vast a space it was not impossible for one person to find what another had missed."

"As one descended the slope the woods became thinner, and bushes, with occasional high trees, took the place of the forest."	"doyle"
"They would have had us share their caves with them, but Lord John would by no means consent to it considering that to do so would put us in their power if they were treacherously disposed."	"doyle"
"I'll stake my good name as a shikarree, said he, that the track is a fresh one."	"doyle"
"On that occasion Professor Summerlee was the chief offender, and though he is now chastened and contrite, the matter could not be entirely forgotten."	"doyle"
"As he did so we saw, at the distance of a mile or so, something which appeared to be a huge gray bird flap slowly up from the ground and skim smoothly off, flying very low and straight, until it was lost among the tree-ferns."	"doyle"
"Old Challenger was up a tree, eatin' pines and havin' the time of his life."	"doyle"

"You've blackened this young man's eye."	"doyle"
"Wasn't he the man who broke the skull of Blundell, of the Telegraph?"	"doyle"
"I leave the strict observance of my conditions entirely to your honor."	"doyle"
"Once I lost myself, and it was only by good luck, and after an hour of wandering, that I found the camp once more."	"doyle"

"Our learned men looked at each other with some hesitation."	"doyle"
"You were in trouble last month for the same thing."	"doyle"
"Any ignoramus can hand down his worthless memory by imposing it upon a mountain or a river."	"doyle"

"I may yet show you how a great mind molds all Nature to its use."	"doyle"
"cried Challenger, in an ecstasy."	"doyle"
"We can at least all reach the summit, said he."	"doyle"
"But McArdle was his first lieutenant, and it was he that we knew."	"doyle"
"I have hinted also at the trouble which the Professor's baggage gave us when we left the plateau, and had I described our voyage I might have said a good deal of the worry we had to coax with putrid fish the appetite of our filthy companion."	"doyle"
"What this phenomenon meant we could not imagine."	"doyle"
"What a prosaic motive!"	"doyle"
"Summerlee had been so interested that he had stood unresisting while Challenger tilted his head into the air."	"doyle"
"Challenger smiled with weary and tolerant contempt, as a kindly man would meet the yapping of a litter of puppies."	"doyle"
"For a long time I lay and watched these red, quivering blotches of light."	"doyle"
"First of all, I wish you to understand that nothing I tell you now is to be repeated in any public way unless you have my express permission."	"doyle"
"I do not speak upon this subject as an amateur, nor, I may add, as a popular lecturer, but I speak as one whose scientific conscience compels him to adhere closely to facts, when I say that Mr. Waldron is very wrong in supposing that because he has never himself seen a so-called prehistoric animal, therefore these creatures no longer exist."	"doyle"
"We beat at them with the stocks of our guns, but there was nothing solid or vulnerable to strike."	"doyle"
"I thought of the Indian superstition of the Curupurithe dreadful, lurking spirit of the woodsand I could have imagined that his terrible presence haunted those who had invaded his most remote and sacred retreat."	"doyle"
"I would do my best to put it through and get you some good copy."	"doyle"
"Foreign Member of'well, quite a lot of things, about two inches of small type'Societe Belge, American Academy of Sciences, La Plata, etc., etc."	"doyle"
"Another instant and the great stealthy hands would have been round my throat."	"doyle"
"This makes my situation different from yours, Professor Challenger, since, so far as I know, you have never been entrusted with any responsible educational work."	"doyle"
"He leaned back in his chair with drooping eyelids and a tolerant smile, basking in this sudden gleam of sunshine."	"doyle"
"Perhaps he might bring help; but in any case he would ensure that our lives were not spent for nothing, and that news of all that we had won for Science should reach our friends at home."	"doyle"
"His tall, gaunt, stringy figure is insensible to fatigue, and his dry, half-sarcastic, and often wholly unsympathetic manner is uninfluenced by any change in his surroundings."	"doyle"
"It is clearly some sort of script, said Challenger."	"doyle"

"The path lay still behind me."	"doyle"
"It was all so unthinkable."	"doyle"
"The whole group of us were covered for an instant by a canopy of leathery wings, and I had a momentary vision of a long, snake-like neck, a fierce, red, greedy eye, and a great snapping beak, filled, to my amazement, with little, gleaming teeth."	"doyle"
"The cases of ammunition and of food were scattered about in a wild litter, together with our unfortunate cameras and plate-carriers, but none of them were missing."	"doyle"

"The Indians carried first our canoes and then our stores through the brushwood, which is very thick at this point, while we four whites, our rifles on our shoulders, walked between them and any danger coming from the woods."	"doyle"
"But Challenger was all right."	"doyle"
"At a rough guess the gulf was forty feet across, but, so far as I could see, it might as well have been forty miles."	"doyle"
"I could notmust notfail."	"doyle"

"Along this a party of the ape-men were passing."	"doyle"
"Now, sir, why should you not follow your brethren?"	"doyle"
"My scientific education having been somewhat neglected, I was unable to follow the whole argument, but it was evident that the English Professor had handled his subject in a very aggressive fashion, and had thoroughly annoyed his Continental colleagues."	"doyle"
"Then where the dooce did they drop from?"	"doyle"
"Well, Challenger, what will you do with your fifty thousand?"	"doyle"
"It was indeed a wonderful sight which lay before us."	"doyle"

"You can wait, Austin."	"doyle"
"Such was the famous Lord John Roxton as he sat opposite to me, biting hard upon his cigar and watching me steadily in a long and embarrassing silence."	"doyle"
"Two of his guards caught him by the wrists and pulled him brutally to the front."	"doyle"
"I could not have accomplished it, nor could Summerlee, if Challenger had not gained the summit (it was extraordinary to see such activity in so unwieldy a creature) and there fixed the rope round the trunk of the considerable tree which grew there."	"doyle"
"I applaud his resolution."	"doyle"
"Never was our expedition in more imminent danger of complete annihilation."	"doyle"

"Such was the cheery cry of our excellent Zambo."	"doyle"
"There were too many for us to shoot, so we fairly took to our heels and ran until we were exhausted."	"doyle"
"And, after all, this opening chapter will seem to the reader to have nothing to do with my narrative; and yet there would have been no narrative without it, for it is only when a man goes out into the world with the thought that there are heroisms all round him, and with the desire all alive in his heart to follow any which may come within sight of him, that he breaks away as I did from the life he knows, and ventures forth into the wonderful mystic twilight land where lie the great adventures and the great rewards."

"Every one was on his feet."	"doyle"

"poe"
"Then the bird said, Nevermore."	"poe"
"And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating 'T is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door; This it is, and nothing more."	"poe"
"Leave my loneliness unbroken!quit the bust above my door!"	"poe"
"And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be liftednevermore!

"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door."	"poe"
"Quoth the Raven, Nevermore."	"poe"
"Nothing further then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered Till I scarcely more than muttered, Other friends have flown before On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."	"poe"
"Surely, said I, surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; 'T is the wind and nothing more!"	"poe"
"Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping, somewhat louder than before."	"poe"
"'T is some visiter, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door Only this, and nothing more."	"poe"
"Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, Sir, said I, or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard youhere I opened wide the door; Darkness there, and nothing more."	"poe"
"Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor."	"poe"
"This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er She shall press, ah, nevermore!"	"poe"

"Quoth the Raven, Nevermore."	"poe"
"Am not I thy mother that bore thee, and loveth thee?"	"twain"

"He saidI think thou callest thyself Miles Hendon, if I heard thee aright?"	"twain"
"In the same instant a rainbow-radiance flashed along the spacious transept; for with one impulse every individual in the great concourse of nobles lifted a coronet and poised it over his or her headand paused in that attitude."	"twain"
"Tom, heavy-hearted, was conducted from the presence, for this last sentence was a death-blow to the hope he had cherished that now he would be set free."	"twain"

"Then, just as he was on the point of losing himself wholly, he distinctly felt something touch him!"	"twain"
"The poor constable, taken by surprise, was speechless, at first, then found his tongue and fell to blustering and threatening; but Hendon was tranquil, and waited with patience till his breath was spent; then said I have a liking to thee, friend, and would not willingly see thee come to harm."	"twain"
"Now the doors swung open; one high-sounding title after another was announced, the personages owning them followed, and the place was quickly half-filled with noble folk and finery."	"twain"
"it shall go hard with What aileth thee?"	"twain"
"But as time wore on, and the prince did not come, Tom's mind became more and more occupied with his new and enchanting experiences, and by little and little the vanished monarch faded almost out of his thoughts; and finally, when he did intrude upon them at intervals, he was become an unwelcome spectre, for he made Tom feel guilty and ashamed."

"As the afternoon wasted away, the lad, wearied with his troubles, sank gradually into a tranquil and healing slumber."	"twain"

"Doth she mistreat thee?"	"twain"
"He stepped quickly back and shut the door."	"twain"
"No, for his uncle would not allow thathe was all-powerful and could and would crush such a movement, of course."	"twain"
"He seated himself upon it, half his body in the dim and flickering light, and the other half in shadow; and so, with his craving eyes bent upon the slumbering boy, he kept his patient vigil there, heedless of the drift of time, and softly whetted his knife, and mumbled and chuckled; and in aspect and attitude he resembled nothing so much as a grizzly, monstrous spider, gloating over some hapless insect that lay bound and helpless in his web."

"Stillness reigns, the torches blink dully, the time drags heavily."	"twain"
"That was sufficient; he did not wait to scan them critically, but hurried on, and never abated his pace till he was far within the twilight depths of the wood."	"twain"
"For a jest, my prince, we did exchange garments."	"twain"
"His grandeurs were stricken valueless: they seemed to fall away from him like rotten rags."	"twain"
"Kneeling, he pretended to kiss the King's foot, and was indignantly spurned; whereupon he went about begging for a rag to paste over the place upon his face which had been touched by the foot, saying it must be preserved from contact with the vulgar air, and that he should make his fortune by going on the highway and exposing it to view at the rate of a hundred shillings a sight."

"twain"
"Used ityet could not explain where it was?"	"twain"
"About nine, the clouds suddenly break away and a shaft of sunshine cleaves the mellow atmosphere, and drifts slowly along the ranks of ladies; and every rank it touches flames into a dazzling splendour of many-coloured fires, and we tingle to our finger-tips with the electric thrill that is shot through us by the surprise and the beauty of the spectacle!"

"They ran forward with woe and dismay in their faces, exclaiming Oh, poor Tom, poor lad!"	"twain"

"If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be cleaned?"	"doyle"
"It is asking much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind, but I need not tell you that it means a very great deal to the country-side."	"doyle"
"This must be the burrow where the stranger lurked."	"doyle"
"It's the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my life."	"doyle"
"So much he had learned from Dr. Mortimer."	"doyle"
"The next night we lowered the lamp, and sat smoking cigarettes without making the least sound."	"doyle"
"Yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence, which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ."	"doyle"
"It would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so."	"doyle"
"Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out."	"doyle"
"And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?"	"doyle"
"It's the man himself, by all that's wonderful and audacious!"	"doyle"
"No, I can't say that."	"doyle"
"The steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall under which I crouched."	"doyle"
"Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart."	"doyle"
"For you to know could not have helped us, and might possibly have led to my discovery."	"doyle"
"Already the first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window."	"doyle"
"The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul, its vastness, and also its grim charm."	"doyle"
"I've been checkmated in London."	"doyle"
"Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir Charles's nervous system was strained to the breaking point."	"doyle"
"Will you come upstairs, Dr. Watson, and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera?"	"doyle"
"Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the family?"	"doyle"
"I understand that you think out little puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give it."	"doyle"
"Give me a telegraph form."	"doyle"
"Oh, he mentioned his name, did he?"	"doyle"
"Then I answer, certainly not."	"doyle"
"The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist."	"doyle"
"It may be lurking among these rocks at this instant."	"doyle"
"Yes, sir, that was the gentleman's name."	"doyle"
"And if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor."	"doyle"
"And you said nothing?"	"doyle"
"In its cold light I saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks, and the long, low curve of the melancholy moor."	"doyle"
"He and his wife had five hundred pounds each."	"doyle"
"So each of my cases displaces the last, and Mlle."	"doyle"
"I hope that you will come also."	"doyle"
"It is so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious."	"doyle"
"I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting."	"doyle"
"There is a dry glitter in his eyes, and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature."	"doyle"
"Can you tell the position of the rooms?"	"doyle"
"My God, can there be some truth in all these stories?"	"doyle"
"On the 4th of May Sir Charles had declared his intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage."	"doyle"
"The word moor only was printed in ink."	"doyle"
"This is most important, said he when I had concluded."	"doyle"
"At this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side."	"doyle"
"Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning."	"doyle"
"After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out."	"doyle"
"But then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was littered."	"doyle"
"As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck."	"doyle"
"I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal known to science."	"doyle"
"A presentation, I see, said Holmes."	"doyle"
"I am more to blame than you, Watson."	"doyle"
"The woman's story hung coherently together, and all my questions were unable to shake it."	"doyle"
"I placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the darkness."	"doyle"
"Her eyes blazed at me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot."	"doyle"
"If he were safely out of the country it would relieve the tax-payer of a burden."	"doyle"
"Fraser, the tutor, died however, and the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy."	"doyle"
"Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?"	"doyle"
"When they had brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly custom."	"doyle"
"I have come prepared to do so, said Holmes, drawing several papers from his pocket."	"doyle"
"That is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a light."	"doyle"
"You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of yesterday."	"doyle"
"Chapter 14 The Hound of the Baskervilles One of Sherlock Holmes's defectsif, indeed, one may call it a defectwas that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment."	"doyle"
"Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?"	"doyle"
"The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before me."	"doyle"
"By thunder, Watson, I am going out to take that man!"	"doyle"
"And yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers."	"doyle"
"That is certainly the dining-room."	"doyle"
"What's the matter with me, anyhow?"	"doyle"
"For this reason I saw a good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville."	"doyle"
"It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here to see you."	"doyle"
"One cannot always have the success for which one hopes."	"doyle"
"You acknowledge now that you wrote it?"	"doyle"
"He had not seen this lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me."	"doyle"
"Who is the gentleman with the telescope?"	"doyle"
"Immediately after breakfast."	"doyle"
"You can pack our things, said the butler."	"doyle"
"And the man, as the story goes, was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track."	"doyle"
"Have you read anything else in this message, Mr. Holmes?"	"doyle"
"The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow light of the hall."	"doyle"
"Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this morning."	"doyle"
"Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay."	"doyle"
"Then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut."	"doyle"
"The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the fire."	"doyle"
"But we'll search the house and make sure."	"doyle"
"Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid's, he swung them to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor."	"doyle"
"Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste Gum, said Holmes."	"doyle"
"I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case."	"doyle"
"A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of the wagonette."	"doyle"
"He comes in fifty minutes."	"doyle"
"Then let me have the private ones."	"doyle"
"I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling."	"doyle"
"All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall."	"doyle"
"He then, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and so had the chance for which he had waited."	"doyle"
"The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may guess, than when they started."	"doyle"
"They all agreed that it was a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral."	"doyle"
"No, I confess that I see no connection."	"doyle"
"When the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete."	"doyle"
"I would suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials 'C.C.'"	"doyle"
"This was certainly where the man lived."	"doyle"
"I should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind."	"doyle"
"Sitting in the billiard-room I more than once heard the sound of voices raised, and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion."	"doyle"
"But now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast."	"doyle"
"He is very well, thank you."	"doyle"
"Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us."	"doyle"
"It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer."	"doyle"
"To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire, and my acquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the air."	"doyle"
"Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again."	"doyle"
"No mention of that local hunt, Watson, said Holmes with a mischievous smile, but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed."	"doyle"
"I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin."	"doyle"
"The address, you observe is printed in rough characters."	"doyle"
"He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us by about half."	"doyle"
"MY DEAR HOLMES,My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner of the world."	"doyle"
"There's the devilish cunning of it!"	"doyle"
"For the moment I could proceed no farther in that direction, but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor."	"doyle"
"You will see how impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor."	"doyle"
"Then the clothes have been the poor devil's death, said he."	"doyle"
"Be the answer what it might, I should at least have something to report to Sherlock Holmes."	"doyle"
"He insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart, and he gave me a lift homeward."	"doyle"
"Your net and box would have told me as much, said I, for I knew that Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist."	"doyle"
"I heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers."	"doyle"
"I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me from the window of his surgery as you passed."	"doyle"
"Well, it is rather obvious."	"doyle"
"There was a long pause which showed that he had stopped."	"doyle"
"And I would have you believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed."	"doyle"
"We tore away his collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time."	"doyle"
"The man was elderly and infirm."	"doyle"
"And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my mind about the matter."	"doyle"
"Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture."	"doyle"
"I wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it was some distance away."	"doyle"
"He could hide his hound, but he could not hush its voice, and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear."	"doyle"
"I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district, and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night."	"doyle"
"Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul."	"doyle"
"When the butler had left us Sir Henry turned to me."	"doyle"
"He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth."	"doyle"
"Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him."	"doyle"
"I give you my word, sir, that it is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it."	"doyle"
"Very good, Barrymore."	"doyle"
"As long as I have my trousers I have a hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something in it."	"doyle"
"I raised it, and this was what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil: Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey."	"doyle"
"It had not crossed my mind, however, that he would wish me to go with him, nor could I understand how we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to be critical."	"doyle"
"I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it came from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable things which I have ever known."	"doyle"
"The young heir glanced round with a gloomy face."	"doyle"
"I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get away from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it."	"doyle"
"It is only two years since he took up his residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have been interrupted by his death."	"doyle"
"When did he say this?"	"doyle"
"This article, you say, contains all the public facts?"	"doyle"
"Resisting Stapleton's offer of hospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to return alone."	"doyle"
"Ah, well, I don't suppose you will forget your first visit."	"doyle"
"They were tan boots and had never been varnished."	"doyle"
"It was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground, the head doubled under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault."	"doyle"
"It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been to Baskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be necessary to take her there, and could not have returned to Coombe Tracey until the early hours of the morning."	"doyle"
"Halloa, Watson, what's this?"	"doyle"
"said Holmes, he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes."	"doyle"
"We were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive, so we took a gray view of the place."	"doyle"
"There was something subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty."	"doyle"
"What it all means I cannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of."	"doyle"
"And you, Watson, see what comes of abandoning your charge!"	"doyle"
"We are going too far, said Holmes."	"doyle"
"I've been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in the morning, said the baronet."	"doyle"
"Both of the women concerned in the case, Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left with a strong suspicion against Stapleton."	"doyle"
"Then my gentleman threw up the trap, and he cried that I should drive right away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go."	"doyle"
"One last question, Holmes, I said, as I rose."	"doyle"
"He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man."	"doyle"
"Sir Henry and I held out our hands to it, for we were numb from our long drive."	"doyle"
"I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the same."	"doyle"
"Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance."	"doyle"
"What, are you coming, Watson?"	"doyle"
"Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness."	"doyle"
"I could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them."	"doyle"
"Then in an instant it was all clear to me."	"doyle"
"Barrymore considers that he has a grievance, he said."	"doyle"
"Why, you had not very much time for talk, her brother remarked with the same questioning eyes."	"doyle"
"Why should I try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts?"	"doyle"
"There's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words."	"doyle"
"One struck, and two, and we had almost for the second time given it up in despair, when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs, with all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more."	"doyle"
"A stranger then is still dogging us, just as a stranger dogged us in London."	"doyle"
"What are you doing here, Barrymore?"	"doyle"
"And then I gave a cry of exultation, for a tiny pin-point of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square framed by the window."	"doyle"
"My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?"	"doyle"
"His sister is everything in his life, he says."	"doyle"
"He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street, conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message."	"doyle"
"Have you met Mr. James Desmond?"	"doyle"
"What do you mean, then?"	"doyle"
"Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he, disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to Baker Street and afterwards to the station and to the Northumberland Hotel."	"doyle"
"Did he find out where he hid, or what he was doing?"	"doyle"
"I suppose one can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the picture at present."	"doyle"
"I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before you and ask for your advice."	"doyle"
"He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square."	"doyle"
"Did you correspond with Sir Charles?"	"doyle"
"But I expect if we could lay our hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles's death."	"doyle"
"Stapleton still looked hard at him."	"doyle"
"The result, however, was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants."	"doyle"
"Then we meet again at two o'clock."	"doyle"
"The man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but with a curious lisping accent."	"doyle"
"Don't you think that is an admirable sentiment?"	"doyle"
"The night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay."	"doyle"
"I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor path branches off."	"doyle"
"Not a shadow of oneonly surmise and conjecture."	"doyle"
"It was suggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and by the desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death."	"doyle"
"If I have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are compromised."	"doyle"
"Mr. Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions and advice."	"doyle"
"But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get anything else."	"doyle"
"It was in the private sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his intentions."	"doyle"
"And now, my dear Watson, without referring to my notes, I cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case."	"doyle"
"We took him in and fed him and cared for him."	"doyle"
"No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors."	"doyle"
"At all costs we must hold our ground where we are."	"doyle"
"Yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires."	"doyle"
"Notdon't tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!"	"doyle"
"Dr. Mortimer here went round with me."	"doyle"
"But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore's movements might be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until I could explain them was more than I could bear."	"doyle"
"To this one purpose I must now devote all my energies."	"doyle"
"Yes, you will find some very singular points about the moor, Dr. Watson."	"doyle"
"As I entered, however, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me coughing."	"doyle"
"If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I'll never forget it."	"doyle"
"The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter, nor could any inquiry clear it up."	"doyle"
"The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out, and yet he was diabolical as well."	"doyle"
"In front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and the deep roar of the hound."	"doyle"
"I have no doubt He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air."	"doyle"
"If its appearance did not frighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the resistance which might be offered."	"doyle"
"Our friend's title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his family."	"doyle"
"So paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our nerve."	"doyle"
"That means that while they are, as we have seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not see them."	"doyle"
"I have no reason to be ashamed of it."	"doyle"
"I observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes."	"doyle"
"Then he turned to me."	"doyle"
"No, sir, I don't know that."	"doyle"
"John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile."	"doyle"
"After you left I sent down to Stamford's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my spirit has hovered over it all day."	"doyle"
"I tell you, Watson, I've only known her these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me, and she, tooshe was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear."	"doyle"
"Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime?"	"doyle"
"Why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?"	"doyle"
"It was nearly nine o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once more."	"doyle"
"But it had not approached the body?"	"doyle"
"Thank God, I think that I hear him coming."	"doyle"
"Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest."	"doyle"
"Good night, sir, and thank you!"	"doyle"
"There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored."	"doyle"
"You'll be all right to-morrow."	"doyle"
"Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels were again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads."	"doyle"
"He has beaten us, Watson."	"doyle"
"Put her in the chair!"	"doyle"
"I will say nothing to add to his anxieties, but I will take my own steps to attain my own end."	"doyle"
"There is Sir Charles's death."	"doyle"
"You would find him an interesting study."	"doyle"
"I turned, expecting to see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing me."	"doyle"
"He stamped his feet upon the ground."	"doyle"
"We may talk further of this some other time."	"doyle"
"We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us."	"doyle"
"That may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter."	"doyle"
"I was able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew at last exactly how I stood."	"doyle"
"I fail to see how you could have done more."	"doyle"
"I learned at the British Museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his Yorkshire days, been the first to describe."	"doyle"
"I could not help asking."	"doyle"
"Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that he said less than he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the baronet."	"doyle"
"To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming wildly for help."	"doyle"
"I told them that they would have occasion to regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come true."	"doyle"
"Watson was asking for orders."	"doyle"
"My friend bowed his compliments."	"doyle"
"She was a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman with a stern set expression of mouth."	"doyle"
"Bogs make queer noises sometimes."	"doyle"
"It might not even now be too late to overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of Merripit House."	"doyle"
"Not a word to show your suspicionsnot a word, or my plans crumble to the ground."	"doyle"
"The worst of it is that I only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never had them on."	"doyle"
"But for God's sake do what I ask you."	"doyle"
"Well, he wasn't altogether such an easy gentleman to describe."	"doyle"
"I may have spoken too warmly, sir, said he, and if I have, I am sure that I beg your pardon."	"doyle"
"I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none."	"doyle"
"Now, listen to me, Barrymore!"	"doyle"
"I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance."	"doyle"
"Holmes laid his hand upon him, and held it up again, with an exclamation of horror."	"doyle"
"He is learned in old manorial and communal rights, and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the village street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest exploit."	"doyle"
"With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that dripping beard was pointing up to the cold, clear moon."	"doyle"
"You don't mean that you know where he is?"	"doyle"
"He would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at the Northumberland Hotel."	"doyle"
"I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences."	"doyle"
"Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this?"	"doyle"
"Whatever you tell me to do I will do."	"doyle"
"I have not come to any conclusion."	"doyle"
"Once only we saw a trace that someone had passed that perilous way before us."	"doyle"
"One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir Charles's."	"doyle"
"By thunder, you're right!"	"doyle"
"Are you armed, Lestrade?"	"doyle"
"They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table."	"doyle"
"That was why he broke prison, sir."	"doyle"
"There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire."	"doyle"
"Can you see anything?"	"doyle"
"I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your instructions."	"doyle"
"At the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds."	"doyle"
"Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting!"	"doyle"
"I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that case of blackmailing."	"doyle"
"The butler brought me my coffee into the library, and I took the chance to ask him a few questions."	"doyle"
"That was my poor uncle's idea."	"doyle"

"We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got away from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in sending back my own name to me through the cabman."	"doyle"
"What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here?"	"doyle"
"Look here, Barrymore, said Sir Henry, sternly; we have made up our minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later."	"doyle"
"Boots, shirt, capit was all Sir Henry's."	"doyle"

"Then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of Princetown."	"doyle"
"And now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyonsit was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone, for I am already aware that she is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter."	"doyle"
"said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching moor."	"doyle"
"Neolithic manno date."	"doyle"

"The lady stood by in haughty silence."	"doyle"

"Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so."	"doyle"

"Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for anything."	"doyle"
"He returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boots."	"doyle"

"It was all very confused."	"doyle"
"Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four."	"doyle"

"Did the pale, watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say?"	"doyle"
"Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?"	"doyle"
"And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright, who would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut, as a dog does at his master's grave, if I had not set his mind at rest about my safety."	"doyle"
"Because I had suggested that he should come over."	"doyle"
"Any one of these stone huts would give him a hiding-place."	"doyle"

"Over the wide expanse there was no sound and no movement."	"doyle"

"That is Sir Henry's nature."	"doyle"
"Have you the dates of those letters?"	"doyle"
"Thence I saw him at once."	"doyle"
"Only that you have disarranged our little deductions."	"doyle"
"I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry Baskerville."	"doyle"
"We know there has been a presentation."	"doyle"
"The Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone."	"doyle"
"My God, what's that, Watson?"	"doyle"
"It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts."	"doyle"
"I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law, and that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it."	"doyle"
"But he will never trouble anyone in this country again."	"doyle"
"You don't mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?"	"doyle"
"In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were lunching."	"doyle"
"Yet he took this document very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him."	"doyle"
"The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls were lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man."	"doyle"
"Barrymore's only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor."	"doyle"
"We believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice."	"doyle"
"They have looked after the Hall for four generations now."	"doyle"
"And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping the appointment?"	"doyle"
"Yes, I think it would be as well."	"doyle"
"I'd prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather."	"doyle"
"But his next remark took a weight from my mind."	"doyle"
"I speak not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles's will."	"doyle"
"That is the exact situation."	"doyle"
"I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far."	"doyle"
"Do not think that it was a delusion, Holmes."	"doyle"
"The fellow is wary and cunning to the last degree."	"doyle"
"We looked back on it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands."	"doyle"
"Foul with mire, with a bristling beard, and hung with matted hair, it might well have belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on the hillsides."	"doyle"
"You quoted some of it."	"doyle"
"I held it as he had done, and stared out into the darkness of the night."	"doyle"
"On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir Henry."	"doyle"
"He scribbled the appointment on his shirtcuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded fashion."	"doyle"
"He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future."	"doyle"
"I ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom."	"doyle"
"The pen has spluttered twice in a single word, and has run dry three times in a short address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle."	"doyle"
"We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry, of triumph, and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from under a cabinet."	"doyle"
"Rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful and sunlit country-side there rose ever, dark against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister hills."	"doyle"
"Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there rose in the distance a gray, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in a dream."	"doyle"
"Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side."	"doyle"
"I don't suppose I should have done so had I not known this legend."	"doyle"
"He was a very tall, thin man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses."	"doyle"
"Where, then, could he have been?"	"doyle"
"Why should she turn so pale?"	"doyle"
"Long afterwards when I had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could not tell whence the sound came."	"doyle"
"Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic tyrant."	"doyle"
"You are the last man that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night."	"doyle"
"As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the words in yesterday's issue."	"doyle"
"We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business which had brought us together."	"doyle"
"I read his record aloud."	"doyle"
"I believed that if I had an interview I could gain his help, so I asked him to meet me."	"doyle"
"It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before."	"doyle"
"If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different thing, said the baronet, you only told us, or rather your wife only told us, when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself."	"doyle"
"A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine."	"doyle"
"I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything definite."	"doyle"
"Her hands were grasping the arms of her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure of her grip."	"doyle"
"Mrs. Lyons knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the death occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only known to him."	"doyle"
"Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and that I might find myself involved in a scandal."	"doyle"
"How long will it take you to make up your mind?"	"doyle"
"That's so, said Baskerville."	"doyle"
"Barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy."	"doyle"
"A few extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory."	"doyle"
"You have arms, I suppose?"	"doyle"
"No, no, we will preserve them upon our list of suspects."	"doyle"
"The thing takes shape, Watson."	"doyle"
"Meanwhile, said he, I have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me."	"doyle"
"Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes, for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down from London."	"doyle"
"said he as if in answer to my thought."	"doyle"
"Have you any better explanation?"	"doyle"
"A lucky long shot of my revolver might have crippled him, but I had brought it only to defend myself if attacked, and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running away."	"doyle"
"In the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood a small cloth bundlethe same, no doubt, which I had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy."	"doyle"
"Barrymore it might possibly have been, but we had left him behind us, and I am certain that he could not have followed us."	"doyle"
"Oh, they are ignorant people."	"doyle"
"Mortimer lunched with us."	"doyle"
"But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor's stick?"	"doyle"
"I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long."	"doyle"
"The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart."	"doyle"
"These rooms appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the house, and the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind."	"doyle"
"Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!"	"doyle"
"Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first sight of the moor, said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the carriage window."	"doyle"
"Another daytwo at the mostand I have my case complete, but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child."	"doyle"
"To all the world he was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the child who had clung to her hand."	"doyle"
"They would be helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal, if he could once effect an entrance."	"doyle"
"Mrs. Stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on several occasions."	"doyle"
"I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled myself."	"doyle"
"Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out in pursuit."	"doyle"
"So far as I know, he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the county."	"doyle"
"But if he had kept faith with me I should always have done so with him."	"doyle"
"The ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate."	"doyle"
"I wonder what your friend Holmes would do, if he were here."	"doyle"
"Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise me to do with him?"	"doyle"
"Watson's reports are most incriminating documents."	"doyle"
"I don't wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this."	"doyle"
"What is the nearest telegraph-office?"	"doyle"
"They live miles from any help."	"doyle"
"We may waste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later we must come upon the right."	"doyle"
"There is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent."	"doyle"
"There go two of my threads, Watson."	"doyle"
"You perceive the devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make a case against the real murderer."	"doyle"
"I searched this room carefully before lunch."	"doyle"
"My hardships were not so great as you imagined, though such trifling details must never interfere with the investigation of a case."	"doyle"
"An orchard surrounded it, but the trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of the whole place was mean and melancholy."	"doyle"
"No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred."	"doyle"
"And now, my dear Watson, we have had some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels."	"doyle"
"There was the sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure."	"doyle"
"The probability lies in that direction."	"doyle"
"The fellow had evidently made inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate."	"doyle"
"There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some little time here."	"doyle"
"We could prove nothing against him."	"doyle"
"I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his almoner upon several occasions, so the lady's statement bore the impress of truth upon it."	"doyle"
"It is melancholy outside and in."	"doyle"
"It is he, then, who is our enemyit is he who dogged us in London?"	"doyle"
"I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial."	"doyle"
"I am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport."	"doyle"
"This, then, is the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to play it again."	"doyle"
"Have no hesitation in lighting one."	"doyle"
"On the other hand, if I should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it I must remain there, however long the vigil, until he returned."	"doyle"
"Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket, and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before."	"doyle"
"I suppose that fits into its place."	"doyle"
"Another covered the lower part of the face, and over it two dark eyeseyes full of grief and shame and a dreadful questioningstared back at us."	"doyle"
"Do you know how he died?"	"doyle"
"Do you see that Black Tor over yonder?"	"doyle"
"I saw by the baronet's clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he regarded as our desertion."	"doyle"
"Now he halted in the recess of the window."	"doyle"
"We're not likely to forget him."	"doyle"
"One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped convict upon the moor."	"doyle"
"We know that there is someone who has the facts if we can only find her."	"doyle"
"The western window through which he had stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the houseit commands the nearest outlook on the moor."	"doyle"
"Baskerville Hall, said he."	"doyle"
"And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination, I answered."	"doyle"
"Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements."	"doyle"
"From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage."	"doyle"
"They are very hospitable people, and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you."	"doyle"
"He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously."	"doyle"
"But the shock of the night's adventures had shattered his nerves, and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever, under the care of Dr. Mortimer."	"doyle"
"Then had you not better consult him?"	"doyle"
"There is our friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I believe to be entirely honest, and there is his wife, of whom we know nothing."	"doyle"
"Our driver half turned in his seat."	"doyle"
"With characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once, and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel was well bribed to help him in his design."	"doyle"
"So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up."	"doyle"
"I said it in London, Watson, and I say it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonderhe swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor."	"doyle"
"Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to Baker Street, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind, like my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted."	"doyle"
"No wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did, and as we ourselves might have done, when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track."	"doyle"
"And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your letter?"	"doyle"
"You will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my indexed list of cases."	"doyle"
"He leaned back, put his finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression."	"doyle"
"What has he against me?"	"doyle"
"Now he was dancing and laughing and wringing my hand."	"doyle"
"He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons to write this letter, imploring the old man to give her an interview on the evening before his departure for London."	"doyle"
"Stapleton's first idea was that this young stranger from Canada might possibly be done to death in London without coming down to Devonshire at all."	"doyle"
"There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant, though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by sharing all his plans with him."	"doyle"
"I thought of the convict out upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor."	"doyle"
"It is a white wooden gate with a latch."	"doyle"
"All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant was bringing nearer."	"doyle"
"OCTOBER 17TH.All day to-day the rain poured down, rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves."	"doyle"
"Holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly interested."	"doyle"
"But, after what we have heard I don't feel as if I could give the man up, so there is an end of it."	"doyle"
"I wished him to help me."	"doyle"
"I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of my convictions."	"doyle"
"And this Cavalier opposite to methe one with the black velvet and the lace?"	"doyle"
"And the messenger of good fortune was none other than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, gray-whiskered and red-faced, outside the gate of his garden, which opened on to the high road along which I travelled."	"doyle"
"If he would confine his energies to this all would be well, but there are rumours that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening a grave without the consent of the next-of-kin, because he dug up the Neolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down."	"doyle"
"He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel."	"doyle"
"We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished in front of us."	"doyle"
"You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject."	"doyle"
"I must thank you, said Sherlock Holmes, for calling my attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest."	"doyle"
"Then get your revolver and put on your boots."	"doyle"
"Ask me what you like, and there is nothing which I shall hold back."	"doyle"
"Poor Sir Charles's head was of a very rare type, half Gaelic, half Ivernian in its characteristics."	"doyle"
"Nothing stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly from a tor behind us."	"doyle"
"Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and monstrous?"	"doyle"
"When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of modern England behind you, but on the other hand you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people."	"doyle"
"A key turned in a lock, and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from within."	"doyle"
"Why, there's no good my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I do already, said he."	"doyle"
"These are his wigwams with the roofs off."	"doyle"
"I was uneasy about Sir Henry."	"doyle"
"Don't you see now whence these words have been taken?"	"doyle"
"And then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?"	"doyle"
"So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff."	"doyle"
"At the same time, I was very much surprised when I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you had been chasing Selden."	"doyle"
"At the same time, said Baskerville, it's clear enough that so long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do."	"doyle"
"If you have read the letter you will know."	"doyle"
"He was just white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury."	"doyle"
"If the earth told a true story, then Stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled through the fog upon that last night."	"doyle"
"The moor has been thick with them since this fellow escaped."	"doyle"
"I have already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other."	"doyle"
"He led me back into the banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he held it up against the time-stained portrait on the wall."	"doyle"
"I crept down the passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the door."	"doyle"
"The man is certainly a country practitioner."	"doyle"
"Her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter hatred and he saw that she would betray him."	"doyle"
"Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last upon the hounds."	"doyle"
"You are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists between this lady and the man Stapleton?"	"doyle"
"A spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its howling is surely not to be thought of."	"doyle"
"It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it."	"doyle"
"You did not know, Dr. Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?"	"doyle"
"There is the death of the last occupant of the Hall, fulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend, and there are the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor."	"doyle"
"His passion is for the British law, and he has spent a large fortune in litigation."	"doyle"
"He did raise his eyebrows, however, when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence."	"doyle"
"We must cast round for another scent."	"doyle"
"Chapter 5 Three Broken Threads Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching his mind at will."	"doyle"
"Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise."	"doyle"
"It seems natural, does it not?"	"doyle"
"The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all descended."	"doyle"
"That depends on whether you are going on the moor, said I."	"doyle"
"It was a relief to me, after that unnatural restraint, when we at last passed Frankland's house and knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and to the scene of action."	"doyle"
"We have never gone out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could have escaped our notice."	"doyle"
"He might have been the very spirit of that terrible place."	"doyle"
"There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel."	"doyle"
"If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and so atone."	"doyle"
"He had come to offer apologies for his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with Sir Henry in his study, the upshot of their conversation was that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit House next Friday as a sign of it."	"doyle"
"She had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close."	"doyle"
"He's in hiding, too, but he's not a convict as far as I can make out."	"doyle"
"And if you can do so !"	"doyle"
"But the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as ever."	"doyle"
"It was to set her up in a typewriting business."	"doyle"
"Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever since."	"doyle"
"His face was flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his wit's ends what to do."	"doyle"
"It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter, and it said: 'Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock."	"doyle"
"In these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing to find a case where the scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the fallen grandeur of his line."	"doyle"
"But every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting a light in the window, and if there was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him."	"doyle"
"Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature."	"doyle"
"Has it never struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food, and so trace it to him?"	"doyle"
"That we should have heard his screamsmy God, those screams!and yet have been unable to save him!"	"doyle"
"Where had you engaged a seat?"	"doyle"
"And how did you localize me?"	"doyle"
"He said that it might be the calling of a strange bird."	"doyle"
"You may possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer."	"doyle"
"A cold wind swept down from it and set us shivering."	"doyle"
"Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes."	"doyle"
"Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind."	"doyle"
"For all they cared it might have been me, instead of my effigy, which these rascals burned at the stake."	"doyle"
"Even Stapleton's attempt upon Sir Henry that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving murder against our man."	"doyle"
"That is natural enough, and I am glad that he should understand her value."	"doyle"
"I could discern no others."	"doyle"
"By the time that you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready."	"doyle"
"Hush, my brother is coming!"	"doyle"
"There is no devil in hell, Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer."	"doyle"
"Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to get his hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman waiting."	"doyle"
"His features were still composed, but his eyes shone with amused exultation."	"doyle"
"That seems the most reasonable theory, said Stapleton, and he gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief."	"doyle"
"Why, of course, that would explain it."	"doyle"
"To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H., was engraved upon it, with the date 1884."	"doyle"
"We'll have a good look at him, if we can do no more."	"doyle"
"A man's or a woman's?"	"doyle"
"As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a habitation."	"doyle"
"I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should have said it before, but it was long after the inquest that I found it out."	"doyle"
"Well, I'll answer, she said."	"doyle"
"I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day."	"doyle"
"Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor."	"doyle"
"We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house."	"doyle"
"So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next morning."	"doyle"
"I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now."	"doyle"
"I do not think that it is likely."	"doyle"
"But I had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of the Black Tor."	"doyle"
"You look like a general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff."	"doyle"
"The letter had, as I said, been burned and it was not all legible."	"doyle"
"If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that 'keep away' and 'from the' are cut out in one piece."	"doyle"
"The question now is, what shall we do with this poor wretch's body?"	"doyle"
"They lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven Street, which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence."	"doyle"
"I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police."	"doyle"
"That would have accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his wife."	"doyle"
"On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked a stone-strewn slope."	"doyle"
"I was prepared for a hound, but not for such a creature as this."	"doyle"
"I believe you have eyes in the back of your head."	"doyle"
"Here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time kept St. Oliver's private school."	"doyle"
"On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made?"	"doyle"
"Here are twenty-three shillings."	"doyle"
"The probability was, therefore, that she was telling the truth, or, at least, a part of the truth."	"doyle"
"I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not  No, this is my friend Dr. Watson."	"doyle"
"It was during these fruitless quests that he, or rather his ally, was seen by peasants, and that the legend of the demon dog received a new confirmation."	"doyle"
"I sat up with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly three o'clock in the morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs."	"doyle"
"Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure you."	"doyle"
"Why should he wish to live at the place of danger?"	"doyle"
"Between and around these scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor."	"doyle"
"A maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I entered the sitting-room a lady, who was sitting before a Remington typewriter, sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome."	"doyle"
"Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long as he was there we could not desert him."	"doyle"
"I pointed into the darkness."	"doyle"
"But it is a very singular thing, Dr. Mortimer remarked."	"doyle"
"Sir Henry and I both stared at the woman in amazement."	"doyle"
"But we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one."	"doyle"
"He was on the moor path, about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could only be Miss Stapleton."	"doyle"
"And now, Watson, it only remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman, No."	"doyle"
"I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend, Sir Henry, and that I need no help of any kind."	"doyle"
"For some minutes he stood watching intently."	"doyle"
"But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view."	"doyle"
"Half-way down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor."	"doyle"
"It is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of Sir Henry'sthe boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all probabilityand so ran this man down."	"doyle"
"As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank, on which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea."	"doyle"
"The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you."	"doyle"
"This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart."	"doyle"
"With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated and then came back."	"doyle"
"What is the object of these questions?"	"doyle"
"Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey."	"doyle"
"My dear fellow, you exaggerate."	"doyle"
"And yet it was not quite the last."	"doyle"
"The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance of that."	"doyle"
"It may have been that Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give, or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not well, but I could read his fears upon his wicked face."	"doyle"
"He looked sharply from Holmes to me."	"doyle"
"But there was no getting out of it."	"doyle"
"He is very rare and seldom found in the late autumn."	"doyle"
"This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a byword through the West."	"doyle"
"There are points of distinction about it."	"doyle"
"The hound was called off and hurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was left which puzzled the authorities, alarmed the country-side, and finally brought the case within the scope of our observation."	"doyle"
"You are not fit for further adventures to-night."	"doyle"
"Do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment something moving upon that hill- side?"	"doyle"
"What a very shocking affair!"	"doyle"
"It was not as if the Barrymores had taken us into their confidence."	"doyle"
"This will do, said he."	"doyle"
"It is better that I should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control."	"doyle"
"you don't mean to say?"	"doyle"
"And ask at the station office if there is a message for me."	"doyle"
"Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?"	"doyle"
"The rest of our work must be done, and every moment is of importance."	"doyle"
"The coachman, a hard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in a few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road."	"doyle"
"The day had been wet, and Sir Charles's footmarks were easily traced down the Alley."	"doyle"
"I don't know as I could say more than that."	"doyle"
"I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side."	"doyle"
"I asked with some self-importance."	"doyle"
"This very door, said Holmes."	"doyle"
"I followed the footsteps down the Yew Alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my arrival."	"doyle"
"I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at Barrymore."	"doyle"
"Then he passed through the same door as before, and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor."	"doyle"
"A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons of the manager."	"doyle"
"A woman of Spanish blood does not condone such an injury so lightly."	"doyle"
"They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him to know if he had seen the hunt."	"doyle"
"I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently  Just a little, said Holmes."	"doyle"
"Montpensier from the charge of murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her step-daughter, Mlle."	"doyle"
"The moment you arrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name, to say that if he finds the pocket-book which I have dropped he is to send it by registered post to Baker Street."	"doyle"
"I ask you once again why it was that you were so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he received on the day of his death."	"doyle"
"My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville."	"doyle"
"However, if it suits you, we will retire early to-night, and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning."	"doyle"
"If you are here, then it follows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself in the matter, and I am naturally curious to know what view he may take."	"doyle"
"I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame!"	"doyle"
"On the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler, who made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the event."	"doyle"
"said I, with an indifferent manner."	"doyle"
"It all fits together."	"doyle"
"But why keep me in the dark?"	"doyle"
"What do you make of those?"	"doyle"
"There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill."	"doyle"
"Holmes would not listen to such fancies, and I am his agent."	"doyle"
"What does it suggest?"	"doyle"
"Rain squalls drifted across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured clouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in gray wreaths down the sides of the fantastic hills."	"doyle"
"With tingling nerves, but a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant."	"doyle"
"There's another one waiting for you if you can bring any more information."	"doyle"
"We must send for help, Holmes!"	"doyle"
"He did not observe any."	"doyle"
"So I read the riddle."	"doyle"
"You've lived near me for some weeks, Watson."	"doyle"
"And how do you propose to do so?"	"doyle"
"No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog."	"doyle"
"Holmes held the lamp towards it."	"doyle"
"It was a pleasant walk of four miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a small gray hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and the house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the rest."	"doyle"
"At the same instant Lestrade gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground."	"doyle"
"But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him from his announced intention of walking home with me."	"doyle"
"I gave him such consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the Grimpen Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again."	"doyle"
"But not one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr. Watson."	"doyle"
"This is Sir Henry Baskerville, said Dr. Mortimer."	"doyle"
"That is my intention."	"doyle"
"By George, there is another of those miserable ponies!"	"doyle"
"He said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body."	"doyle"
"As far as I could judge, the figure was that of a tall, thin man."	"doyle"
"But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have you been doing?"	"doyle"
"As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his dog-cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of Foulmire."	"doyle"
"I think we'll shut that window again, if you don't mind."	"doyle"
"We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments when I have thought of the Stapletons."	"doyle"
"I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge swelling plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes."	"doyle"
"He stood upon a chair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets."	"doyle"
"He is in charge of the Hall."	"doyle"
"Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces, while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet."	"doyle"
"I do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained."	"doyle"
"I don't pretend to know much about these things, and I'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture."	"doyle"
"But no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes."	"doyle"
"He shall answer for this deed."	"doyle"
"They meet, they write, there is a complete understanding between them."	"doyle"
"Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to London."	"doyle"
"I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to remain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that had occurred."	"doyle"
"I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police."	"doyle"
"You only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that."	"doyle"
"Then how is it that you did not go?"	"doyle"
"She opened her eyes again."	"doyle"
"You do Sir Charles an injustice."	"doyle"
"The melancholy of the moor, the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things tinged my thoughts with sadness."	"doyle"
"He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks."	"doyle"
"When he dragged himself here one night, weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, what could we do?"	"doyle"
"Half-way down is the moor-gate, where the old gentleman left his cigar-ash."	"doyle"
"I was a boy in my 'teens at the time of my father's death, and had never seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the South Coast."	"doyle"
"And so was I at first."	"doyle"
"My heart leaped within me as I saw it."	"doyle"
"That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you."	"doyle"
"Like most clever criminals, he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us."	"doyle"
"Oh, you return to-morrow?"	"doyle"
"He was only a minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn once more and he passed me and re-entered the house."	"doyle"
"There were three possible courses."	"doyle"
"Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment."	"doyle"
"I go round at night to see that they are fastened."	"doyle"
"I have had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this morning."	"doyle"
"Chapter 15 A Retrospection It was the end of November and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in Baker Street."	"doyle"
"She had learned something of the death of the convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the out-house on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner."	"doyle"
"How could I settle the point forever?"	"doyle"
"He had risen and paced the room as he spoke."	"doyle"
"And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?"	"doyle"
"It has certainly a character of its own."	"doyle"
"It is my doing, Sir Henryall mine."	"doyle"
"But we have to prove all this, and we are not in a position to do it."	"doyle"
"I've heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud."	"doyle"
"On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked in the other direction."	"doyle"
"There could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair and gray eyes, while she was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in Englandslim, elegant, and tall."	"doyle"
"And why were you holding a candle to the window?"	"doyle"
"Was it possible that it was Barrymore after all whom we had seen in the cab in Regent Street?"	"doyle"
"But one last word, Watson."	"doyle"
"I am sorry to intrude, but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor."	"doyle"
"I had no difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and well appointed."	"doyle"
"The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us."	"doyle"
"In the great old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled and snapped."	"doyle"
"I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning's conversation for Holmes."	"doyle"
"Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen."	"doyle"
"No; he lay about fifty yards from it."	"doyle"
"It is a singular thing, but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought."	"doyle"
"It seems to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs."	"doyle"
"Because you gave me your word that you would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay."	"doyle"
"That his advances should be rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wishes, and that the lady should accept the situation without protest, is very amazing."	"doyle"
"We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came down."	"doyle"
"Did the composer fear an interruptionand from whom?"	"doyle"
"There is but one danger which can threaten us."	"doyle"
"Mrs. Stapleton knew that he had designs upon the old man, and also of the existence of the hound."	"doyle"
"Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by chance our guardian angel?"	"doyle"
"It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted."	"doyle"
"I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?"	"doyle"
"I have a box for 'Les Huguenots.'"	"doyle"
"That was what brought me out."	"doyle"
"Whatever his crimes, he has suffered something to atone for them."	"doyle"
"Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket."	"doyle"
"There is something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother."	"doyle"
"Then we shall do it together."	"doyle"
"That's a Kneller, I'll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds."	"doyle"
"It was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependents."	"doyle"
"We must leave you now, said Holmes."	"doyle"
"An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene."	"doyle"
"But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has done?"	"doyle"
"No signs of violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles's person, and though the doctor's evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortionso great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before himit was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion."	"doyle"
"We heard the hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition."	"doyle"
"Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town."	"doyle"
"Yes, sir, he is still with us."	"doyle"
"I haven't had such a day since I had Sir John Morland for trespass, because he shot in his own warren."	"doyle"
"Has he remained in London, or has he followed us down here?"	"doyle"
"I trust that Sir Henry is none the worse for his journey?"	"doyle"
"Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting."	"doyle"
"The light beat upon him where he stood, but long shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him."	"doyle"
"In the distant hollow on the left, half hidden by the mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose above the trees."	"doyle"
"Yes, it's rather an uncanny place altogether."	"doyle"
"It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career."	"doyle"
"She hesitated and looked down."	"doyle"
"I cannot think where she is."	"doyle"
"Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?"	"doyle"
"I have found them out."	"doyle"
"He is curiously employed at present, for, being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped convict."	"doyle"
"If I have set it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed."	"doyle"
"I did not say that I desired you to do it."	"doyle"
"Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that you regret that you cannot come."	"doyle"
"You've been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the best I can for you in return."	"doyle"
"Well, if that isn't smart!"	"doyle"
"Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the moor-gate."	"doyle"
"But the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair."	"doyle"
"James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland."	"doyle"
"Barrymore said that he had."	"doyle"
"Of course, I've heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery."	"doyle"
"My dear sir, cried Dr. Mortimer, it is only mislaid."	"doyle"
"No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it."	"doyle"
"It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us."	"doyle"
"I am no antiquarian, but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which none other would occupy."	"doyle"
"Well, Barrymore  God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart!"	"doyle"
"I don't know much of British life yet, for I have spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada."	"doyle"
"That's the truth, sir, said Barrymore."	"doyle"
"It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this morning."	"doyle"
"Isn't that the direction of the great Grimpen Mire?"	"doyle"
"There is no alternative, I assure you."	"doyle"
"does stand for 'Charing Cross Hospital,' what further inferences may we draw?"	"doyle"
"I tell you it is all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I'm as keen as possible to see the moor."	"doyle"
"Meyers, Toronto, was printed on the leather inside."	"doyle"
"And you will report very carefully to me, said Holmes."	"doyle"
"He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and that I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out."	"doyle"
"I feel a foil as quick and supple as my own."	"doyle"
"Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you should not have called me in!"	"doyle"
"But he went out every evening."	"doyle"
"The whole course of events, said Holmes, from the point of view of the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and direct, although to us, who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of the facts, it all appeared exceedingly complex."	"doyle"
"He had usually a great many letters, for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him."	"doyle"
"It was a woman's voice, and Mrs. Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband, was standing at the door."	"doyle"
"She came out and helped the man to hand down our bags."	"doyle"
"I should guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small presentation in return."	"doyle"
"Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I only mention him because you were particular that I should send some description of the people who surround us."	"doyle"
"If I had any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case, I might perhaps even now give you some aid or advice."	"doyle"
"He retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound upon the track."	"doyle"
"There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick."	"doyle"
"She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a curious lisp in her utterance."	"doyle"
"How far do you think it is?"	"doyle"
"He was a very retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth."	"doyle"
"That night he waited there."	"doyle"
"It is a long, dismal walk, the Yew Alley, between two high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band of grass upon either side."	"doyle"
"Quite in the back row, eh?"	"doyle"
"If they had followed him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the second."	"doyle"
"A large scale map, I presume?"	"doyle"
"I did not say that I had read all the letter."	"doyle"
"If you will do this I think the chances are that our little problem will soon be solved."	"doyle"
"There were the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the village of Grimpen."	"doyle"
"As it is, I have been able to get about as I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment."	"doyle"
"I brought Cartwright down with meyou remember the little chap at the express officeand he has seen after my simple wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar."	"doyle"
"I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce?"	"doyle"
"So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville."	"doyle"
"The baronet and I were both upon our feet."	"doyle"
"My dear fellow, said he, Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the moor."	"doyle"
"I quoted the postscript."	"doyle"
"I will tell you, then."	"doyle"
"No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that as well."	"doyle"
"When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will?"	"doyle"
"But as a practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone."	"doyle"
"Something had evidently aroused his suspicions."	"doyle"
"But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house?"	"doyle"
"I do not know what to believe."	"doyle"
"We are coming to that."	"doyle"
"As clearly as I see you."	"doyle"
"This was my conversation with Barrymore just now, which gives me one more strong card which I can play in due time."	"doyle"
"He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain, and was the very image, they tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo."	"doyle"
"How was it that no one else saw it?"	"doyle"
"Sir Charles had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes."	"doyle"
"If their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent it."	"doyle"
"The truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a detective and that I was to say nothing about him to anyone."	"doyle"
"I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to speak to him about it, said he."	"doyle"
"He thought for a few minutes."	"doyle"
"Then your brother is  The escaped convict, sirSelden, the criminal."	"doyle"
"He will have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo to-morrow, when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright, to dine with these people."	"doyle"
"It was all dim and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind it."	"doyle"
"Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion."	"doyle"
"But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to Barrymore and his wife."	"doyle"
"That is very interesting."	"doyle"
"At every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face."	"doyle"
"I found the black tor upon which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit I looked out myself across the melancholy downs."	"doyle"
"Of course, so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all."	"doyle"
"So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes, said Sir Henry Baskerville, someone cut out this message with a scissors Nail-scissors, said Holmes."	"doyle"
"Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind."	"doyle"
"Yet you must admit that the footmark is material."	"doyle"
"And yet it may seem a small matter in itself."	"doyle"
"That was what I wished you to think."	"doyle"
"He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to her, as you have yourself observed."	"doyle"
"Bear in mind, Sir Henry, one of the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr. Mortimer has read to us, and avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil are exalted."	"doyle"
"Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it."	"doyle"
"Fool that I was to hold my hand."	"doyle"
"She always comes to us when she is in town."	"doyle"
"So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county."	"doyle"
"What are your questions?"	"doyle"
"Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is, said the postmaster testily."	"doyle"
"I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton."	"doyle"
"There only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two men, the murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted over their cigars."	"doyle"
"Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of Oxford Street."	"doyle"
"You bear him no good will, madam, said Holmes."	"doyle"
"Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time."	"doyle"
"You could not make a greater mistake."	"doyle"
"If the gipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be."	"doyle"
"I was glad enough to agree."	"doyle"
"Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir."	"doyle"
"I have not heard of any."	"doyle"
"If she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else."	"doyle"
"Then another and yet another, coming nearer and nearer."	"doyle"
"There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our visitor."	"doyle"
"Queer place, the moor!"	"doyle"
"I closed the curtain, feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest."	"doyle"
"I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities."	"doyle"
"He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale and trembling in every limb."	"doyle"
"I've not heard of him since I left out food for him last, and that was three days ago."	"doyle"
"There have been decorators and furnishers up from Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend has large ideas, and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family."	"doyle"
"In half an hour we won't be able to see our hands in front of us."	"doyle"
"From that moment he understood that I had taken over the case in London, and that therefore there was no chance for him there."	"doyle"
"It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull."	"doyle"
"You would have wished to tell me something, or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run."	"doyle"
"We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body, overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end."	"doyle"
"Well, then, supposing that 'C.C.H.'"	"doyle"
"Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?"	"doyle"
"When he did not come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I heard cries upon the moor."	"doyle"
"And then again, there is the 'friends of the C.C.H.'"	"doyle"
"I have heard your name mentioned in connection with that of your friend."	"doyle"
"I whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the drive."	"doyle"
"I feel sure that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place."	"doyle"
"Oh Holmes, I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate."	"doyle"
"These details are all of great interest."	"doyle"
"[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John, with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister Elizabeth.]"	"doyle"
"You have been walking for some months very near to the edge of a precipice."	"doyle"
"The poor fellow has enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track."	"doyle"
"Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay."	"doyle"
"We succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and Dr. Mortimer assure me will be a temporary one."	"doyle"
"Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below, for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who said them."	"doyle"
"Beyond it lies the wide moor."	"doyle"
"It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who was being dogged by this secret man."	"doyle"
"From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again."	"doyle"
"Did any see it after?"	"doyle"
"The last of these, at Folkestone Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistoling of the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar."	"doyle"
"It was of common quality, grayish in colour."	"doyle"
"Keep your revolver near you night and day, and never relax your precautions."	"doyle"
"One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can possibly do."	"doyle"
"It is here in the corner."	"doyle"
"I do not believe in such nonsense."	"doyle"
"I assure you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive."	"doyle"
"So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea, with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on."	"doyle"
"A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of Baskerville Hall."	"doyle"
"He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be of assistance to me."	"doyle"
"I had waited patiently for the opportunity, for I was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap, and that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past."	"doyle"
"We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer."	"doyle"
"The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us in the passage."	"doyle"
"May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?"	"doyle"
"They have treated me shamefullyshamefully."	"doyle"
"Dr. Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it to us."	"doyle"
"I thought of the strange warning clipped out of the leading article of the Times."	"doyle"
"It is a wonderful place, the moor, said he, looking round over the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges."	"doyle"
"Sir Henry has, I suppose, no superstitious fears in the matter?"	"doyle"
"Did you see him come out on us?"	"doyle"
"In that case, regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife."	"doyle"
"Now, said Sir Henry Baskerville, perhaps you will tell me, Mr. Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes so much interest in my affairs?"	"doyle"
"As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir Henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair, puffing at his cigar."	"doyle"
"The biggest thing for years, said Holmes."	"doyle"
"You saved my good name, and perhaps my life."	"doyle"
"We knew him very intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house."	"doyle"
"He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed."	"doyle"
"I assure you that I have never in my life seen anything more clearly."	"doyle"
"In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord."	"doyle"
"Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it."	"doyle"
"We had heard the creak of a step in the passage."	"doyle"
"The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had time to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily."	"doyle"
"My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I abhor."	"doyle"
"So that to reach the Yew Alley one either has to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?"	"doyle"
"Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare say he has many a time regretted it since."	"doyle"
"Nor can it be denied that many of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious."	"doyle"
"Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass."	"doyle"
"Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in Godno, in Little Russia, in the year '66, and of course there are the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case possesses some features which are entirely its own."	"doyle"
"Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can take."	"doyle"
"All this, Dr. Watson, has been brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window."	"doyle"
"A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it."	"doyle"
"In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter for myself."	"doyle"
"Your place should be at Baskerville Hall."	"doyle"
"The figure was far taller than that of Stapleton, far thinner than that of Frankland."	"doyle"
"But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the inquest."	"doyle"
"Even now, in the stillness of death, the huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the small, deep-set, cruel eyes were ringed with fire."	"doyle"
"The other words were all simple and might be found in any issue, but 'moor' would be less common."	"doyle"
"The fault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side."	"doyle"
"To-morrow morning I shall find my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of equivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of mysteries."	"doyle"
"The lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a new building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles's South African gold."	"doyle"
"Let us see if we can get a glimpse of him."	"doyle"
"I really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our calculations."	"doyle"
"In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page of the Times among it."	"doyle"
"I was dependent upon him for food and clean linen."	"doyle"
"It's moving towards us, Watson."	"doyle"
"His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a serious effect upon his health."	"doyle"
"Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window, I suggested."	"doyle"
"Then he was certainly there?"	"doyle"
"Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day."	"doyle"
"Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put it into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore's hands, and she promised to deliver it at once."	"doyle"
"I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob of a woman."	"doyle"
"There were pride, valour, and strength in his thick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes."	"doyle"
"I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot."	"doyle"
"It was certain that I could not help with those."	"doyle"
"I suppose that by Saturday all might be ready?"	"doyle"
"I did not positively say so."	"doyle"
"James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore at the Hall last week, did you not?"	"doyle"
"Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed."	"doyle"
"With designs upon the succession."	"doyle"
"When they were gone we looked out of the window again."	"doyle"
"I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon gravel."	"doyle"
"It is our friend Sir Henry's missing boot."	"doyle"
"Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone."	"doyle"
"The man is a public danger."	"doyle"
"How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted?"	"doyle"
"We were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no harm."	"doyle"
"I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife."	"doyle"
"It is not the baronetit iswhy, it is my neighbour, the convict!"	"doyle"
"There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the wrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from which I could command a viewthe same hill which is cut into the dark quarry."	"doyle"
"Then you returned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he lay in hiding there."	"doyle"
"We know at least that he came so far in safety."	"doyle"
"My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor."	"doyle"
"I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what he wants."	"doyle"
"Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were waiting for us upon the platform."	"doyle"
"It ran 'Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o'clock.'"	"doyle"
"It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand."	"doyle"
"Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester."	"doyle"
"Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold."	"doyle"
"He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it."	"doyle"
"To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon must always appeal strongly."	"doyle"
"They are all family portraits, I presume?"	"doyle"
"You will find it when you return to the hotel."	"doyle"
"He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one, and gives nothing away."	"doyle"
"I owe him nothing, and his friends are not mine."	"doyle"
"Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible."	"doyle"
"I have cross-examined these men, one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the legend."	"doyle"
"Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are L. L.?"	"doyle"
"I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty."	"doyle"
"He is no one whom I have seen down here, and I have now met all the neighbours."	"doyle"
"I remember the look in your eyes."	"doyle"
"If you have not had any report within the last few days it is because up to to-day there was nothing of importance to relate."	"doyle"
"No doubt, said I; but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor?"	"doyle"
"Sir Henry had flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces."	"doyle"
"I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked me to furnish you only with facts."	"doyle"
"And how much was the residue?"	"doyle"
"And yet the more I thought of the lady's face and of her manner the more I felt that something was being held back from me."	"doyle"
"Look at the noises on the moor at night."	"doyle"
"We shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can resist."	"doyle"
"I don't like it, Dr. WatsonI tell you straight, sir, that I don't like it."	"doyle"
"But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?"	"doyle"
"There were reasons why I could not get there earlier."	"doyle"
"That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing by."	"doyle"
"If it concerned no one but myself I would not try to keep it from you."	"doyle"
"It chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate."	"doyle"
"I've had no time, for it was only yesterday that I learned how matters stood."	"doyle"
"And you go in disgrace."	"doyle"
"It is incredible, impossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature."	"doyle"
"Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his will."	"doyle"
"Yet I am certain that he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being tête-à-tête."	"doyle"
"Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides."	"doyle"
"Yes, I did write it, she cried, pouring out her soul in a torrent of words."	"doyle"
"A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor, lay in front of us."	"doyle"
"So, between the old sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time."	"doyle"
"The noise could not have been far away and was certainly in the house."	"doyle"
"Here is a photograph of the couple taken in York four years ago."	"doyle"
"Stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so cleverly concealed."	"doyle"
"Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night."	"doyle"
"This matter cuts very deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I am conscious always of power and design."	"doyle"
"Their secret had been forced from them."	"doyle"
"In one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined."	"doyle"
"You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry."	"doyle"
"My wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you until you have made your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new conditions this house will require a considerable staff."	"doyle"
"If you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain I'll be ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time."	"doyle"
"And even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor."	"doyle"
"Tell me straight, now!"	"doyle"
"The baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from London, so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon."	"doyle"
"Ha, I see that Cartwright has brought up some supplies."	"doyle"
"Being himself childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the whole country-side should, within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end."	"doyle"
"The Stapletons came in afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the Yew Alley, at Sir Henry's request, to show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night."	"doyle"
"Why should she have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy?"	"doyle"
"Mr. Holmes, she said, this man had offered me marriage on condition that I could get a divorce from my husband."	"doyle"
"But incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards."	"doyle"
"You will take this train to town, Cartwright."	"doyle"
"Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don't like."	"doyle"
"He passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to the convict?"	"doyle"
"I came away baffled and disheartened."	"doyle"
"He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead."	"doyle"
"What became of the hound when its master was in London?"	"doyle"

"I never hurt man or woman in my life that I know of."	"doyle"
"A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky."	"doyle"
"I could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical man."	"doyle"
"The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons under Pitt."	"doyle"
"The residue all went to Sir Henry."	"doyle"
"His face was flushed with anger, and he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands."	"doyle"
"I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were erroneous."	"doyle"
"The lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so still that it might have been that of a clear-cut classical statue, a personification of alertness and expectation."	"doyle"
"I give you my solemn word upon that."	"doyle"
"That's better, said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face."	"doyle"
"Well, then, here is your half-sovereign."	"doyle"
"We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a desperate fellow."	"doyle"
"Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging."	"doyle"
"You're mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes."	"doyle"
"What do you think of that?"	"doyle"
"Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death of Sir Charles Baskerville."	"doyle"
"The road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders."	"doyle"
"I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have puzzled us?"	"doyle"
"Never was there such a single-minded enthusiast as he!"	"doyle"
"There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type of a Times article and the slovenly print of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your negro and your Esquimau."	"doyle"
"Again and again it sounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident, wild, and menacing."	"doyle"
"Chapter 9 (Second Report of Dr. Watson) THE LIGHT UPON THE MOOR BASKERVILLE HALL, Oct. 15th."	"doyle"
"It was evident, however, that I could not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly on his guard."	"doyle"
"Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the parish to make him open it."	"doyle"
"You have indeed much to answer for."	"doyle"
"How in the world can you say that?"	"doyle"
"Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry."	"doyle"
"By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel."	"doyle"
"With a cry of surprise I pointed him out to the baronet, but in the instant during which I had turned to grasp his arm the man was gone."	"doyle"
"It was evident to me that he had been very busy of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street were few and short, with no comments upon the information which I had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission."	"doyle"
"One fact which has not been explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master's footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes."	"doyle"
"It's about poor Sir Charles's death."	"doyle"
"Is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station?"	"doyle"
"We may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be known, by you."	"doyle"
"But this is nothingnothing!"	"doyle"
"Our friends are wise, for it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk."	"doyle"
"There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end."	"doyle"
"House, land, and dollars must go together."	"doyle"
"This also you cleared up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations."	"doyle"
"This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire."	"doyle"
"At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that this may be so."	"doyle"
"What do you advise that we do now?"	"doyle"
"It cannot much matter to him whether it is early or late for the orchids."	"doyle"
"You have been at your club all day, I perceive."	"doyle"
"Chapter 3 The Problem I confess at these words a shudder passed through me."	"doyle"
"There only remains one difficulty."	"doyle"
"At his command she consented to pass as his sister, though he found the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder."	"doyle"
"Partly also from his professional caution, which urged him never to take any chances."	"doyle"
"It may possibly recur to your memory that when I examined the paper upon which the printed words were fastened I made a close inspection for the water-mark."	"doyle"
"Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire."	"doyle"
"In some ways they have within the last forty-eight hours become much clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated."	"doyle"
"The beast was savage and half-starved."	"doyle"
"He is much attached to her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her making so brilliant a marriage."	"doyle"
"For God's sake put such an idea out of your mind, said he."	"doyle"
"My feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what I had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was anxious to send Perkins and the wagonette home, and the opportunity was a good one."	"doyle"
"Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us, said Holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of the express from town."	"doyle"
"Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their interview."	"doyle"
"By the way, Mortimer, said I as we jolted along the rough road, I suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom you do not know?"	"doyle"
"No one could have known."	"doyle"
"Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears to be both physical and spiritual."	"doyle"
"When the butler had gone I walked over to the black window, and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees."	"doyle"
"He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he was warmly greeted by the manager."	"doyle"
"On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless."	"doyle"
"It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on upon the moor, said Dr. Mortimer."	"doyle"
"You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson?"	"doyle"
"We must ask about this right away."	"doyle"
"Not a moment to lose!"	"doyle"
"You saw me, perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?"	"doyle"
"I am not sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole household."	"doyle"
"Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens."	"doyle"
"But the practical point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall."	"doyle"
"I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county, I remarked."	"doyle"
"I have no doubt that my friend's explanation will cover the facts."	"doyle"
"It was my game to watch Stapleton."	"doyle"
"How do you know that the woman is his wife?"	"doyle"
"It was a fine apartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and heavily raftered with huge balks of age-blackened oak."	"doyle"
"But I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton, said I. I am Sir Henry's friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine."	"doyle"
"No more than you have."	"doyle"
"Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest which he took in our curious companion."	"doyle"
"Between ourselves there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton."	"doyle"
"To rake this up couldn't help our poor master, and it's well to go carefully when there's a lady in the case."	"doyle"
"My own was in the same wing as Baskerville's and almost next door to it."	"doyle"
"You make too much of it, Dr. Watson, said she."	"doyle"
"Surely your memory deceives you, said I. I could even quote a passage of your letter."	"doyle"
"It was to meet a woman."	"doyle"
"Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent."	"doyle"
"Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it."	"doyle"
"There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense."	"doyle"
"He walked into the room, and as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood, livid and trembling, before us."	"doyle"
"You think that he was waiting for someone?"	"doyle"
"He was thin and worn, but clear and alert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind."	"doyle"
"Do you think that I should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry?"	"doyle"
"But how about the case?"	"doyle"
"At last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south wall she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall and her father's farm."	"doyle"
"I am perfectly satisfied with your company if you will tolerate mine."	"doyle"
"That's how I come to know the name."	"doyle"
"First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London in order to make sure that Barrymore was really here."	"doyle"
"I waited quite a time, but there was no more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream."	"doyle"
"Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have done had it not been for my wife."	"doyle"
"Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been on the night before."	"doyle"
"Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track."	"doyle"
"That is where he would fly."	"doyle"
"I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt."	"doyle"
"I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest."	"doyle"
"No, Watson; I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprints of the world."	"doyle"
"Where have you dropped from?"	"doyle"
"We had risen from our rocks and were turning to go home, having abandoned the hopeless chase."	"doyle"
"The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him."	"doyle"
"You see, for example, this great plain to the north here with the queer hills breaking out of it."	"doyle"
"I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as much as I outpaced the little professional."	"doyle"
"Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated Times leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this singular message."	"doyle"
"No, no, I did not mean my husband."	"doyle"
"First of all your name and address, in case I want you again."	"doyle"
"Two or three times I have heard his steps in the passage, coming and going, just about the hour you name."	"doyle"
"He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done the old uncle with his bogie hound."	"doyle"
"There was a thrill in the doctor's voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he told us."	"doyle"
"Far away in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow light."	"doyle"
"The idea of using her as a decoy was clearly already in his mind, though he may not have been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged."	"doyle"
"What, in heaven's name, was it?"	"doyle"
"I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again."	"doyle"
"The baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness."	"doyle"
"Please forget the words I said, which have no application whatever to you."	"doyle"
"That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard something of the sort."	"doyle"
"What's he waiting for?"	"doyle"
"Already our friend's eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move."	"doyle"
"She would have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton was at a deadlock."	"doyle"
"It had wandered on to the moor and had never come back."	"doyle"
"She shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with horror that they were all mottled with bruises."	"doyle"
"Things have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated."	"doyle"
"I sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog."	"doyle"
"I could only stare at her in stupid surprise."	"doyle"
"Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother."	"doyle"
"Carére has blurred my recollection of Baskerville Hall."	"doyle"
"Dr. Mortimer started violently."	"doyle"
"Did he ever strike you as being crazythis brother of hers?"	"doyle"
"To think that this should be the same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived."	"doyle"
"I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and I came down secretly when I was supposed to be in London."	"doyle"
"I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it was Barrymore."	"doyle"
"Because I received help in the interval from another source."	"doyle"
"Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound, and so on."	"doyle"
"I fear that we shall never again be easy in our minds at Baskerville Hall."	"doyle"
"Shall I run on and stop them?"	"doyle"
"It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dullless for you, perhaps, than for your sister."	"doyle"
"But we hold several threads in our hands, and the odds are that one or other of them guides us to the truth."	"doyle"
"Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were in front of them."	"doyle"
"It has not been a satisfactory case."	"doyle"
"He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes."	"doyle"
"It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county, said Dr. Mortimer."	"doyle"
"We have been talking at cross purposes, said she."	"doyle"
"The unknown might be lurking there, or he might be prowling on the moor."	"doyle"
"It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his guests to carry food and drinkwith other worse things, perchanceto his captive, and so found the cage empty and the bird escaped."	"doyle"
"are placed before that hospital the words 'Charing Cross' very naturally suggest themselves."	"doyle"
"Could you ring him up?thank you!"	"doyle"
"Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind."	"doyle"
"I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson, said she."	"doyle"
"Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar."	"doyle"
"Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at the 10:30 train from Paddington."	"doyle"
"He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that Sir Charles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman, Mrs. Laura Lyons."	"doyle"
"There is no object in our following them, said Holmes."	"doyle"
"In doing so I held it within a few inches of my eyes, and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine."	"doyle"
"Her eyes and teeth gleamed with fierce merriment."	"doyle"
"Go straight back to London, instantly."	"doyle"
"For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt message."	"doyle"
"A litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and a half-full bottle of spirits standing in the corner."	"doyle"
"At one end a minstrel's gallery overlooked it."	"doyle"
"Nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot two nights before."	"doyle"
"And what deep and earnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial!"	"doyle"
"The story took a great hold upon the imagination of Sir Charles, and I have no doubt that it led to his tragic end."	"doyle"
"Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson, said he."	"doyle"
"You have always kept together, I presume?"	"doyle"
"But the next instant Holmes had emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creature's flank."	"doyle"
"Have you been on the moor already?"	"doyle"
"Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle!"	"doyle"
"Don't you think, Watson, that you are away from your charge rather long?"	"doyle"
"To do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants, who are not content with a mere fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell-fire shooting from his mouth and eyes."	"doyle"
"The dog, incited by its master, sprang over the wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming down the Yew Alley."	"doyle"
"On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire."	"doyle"
"Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall."	"doyle"
"You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned or removed."	"doyle"
"You cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains."	"doyle"
"This at least was real, but it might have been the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy."	"doyle"
"I must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper."	"doyle"
"He chanced to be at his hall door."	"doyle"
"It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carrydignified, solid, and reassuring."	"doyle"
"I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness."	"doyle"
"He laughed at my bewildered expression."	"doyle"
"The servants had left the kitchen."	"doyle"
"What is this, Perkins?"	"doyle"
"The scent suggested the presence of a lady, and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons."	"doyle"
"I hope, said Dr. Mortimer, that you do not look with suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir Charles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me."	"doyle"
"It's a sound they have on the moor."	"doyle"
"He spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness."	"doyle"
"It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray."	"doyle"
"I remember that he refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though he pressed it upon him."	"doyle"
"But I have done my duty now and I will say no more."	"doyle"
"There it was again upon our left!"	"doyle"
"One is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing."	"doyle"
"The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?"	"doyle"
"It has been an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business."	"doyle"
"I could not make it out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens."	"doyle"
"Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor."	"doyle"
"Consider the long sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is at work around us."	"doyle"
"There are several points upon which we still want lightbut it is coming all the same."	"doyle"
"I just don't attempt to explain it."	"doyle"
"To commit a crime would be to show where he was hiding."	"doyle"
"What does man want more?"	"doyle"
"He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heartso much so that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night."	"doyle"
"But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we expected to see."	"doyle"
"But I didsome little distance off, but fresh and clear."	"doyle"
"You can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside."	"doyle"
"The young man when last heard of was in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to informing him of his good fortune."	"doyle"
"I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family connection."	"doyle"
"There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed suitthe very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had seen him in Baker Street."	"doyle"
"That was why I put them out."	"doyle"
"And now, Dr. James Mortimer  Mister, sir, Mistera humble M.R.C.S."	"doyle"
"There is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor, and there are one or two other neighbours."	"doyle"
"I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be more, for his own affairs are considerably involved."	"doyle"
"The light shone steadily as if he were standing motionless."	"doyle"
"Yes, father, I delivered it."	"doyle"
"It is true that if any sudden danger had threatened him I was too far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that you will agree with me that the position was very difficult, and that there was nothing more which I could do."	"doyle"
"I act entirely from a sense of public duty."	"doyle"
"But you were very young when you last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?"	"doyle"
"And I should be glad to have change of this five-pound note."	"doyle"
"Not a whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped."	"doyle"
"What are those latticed windows at this end?"	"doyle"
"Ah, you have a right to know about him."	"doyle"
"Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know, said Holmes to the porter."	"doyle"
"For both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank."	"doyle"
"He told us of similar cases, where families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter."	"doyle"
"I didn't think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir Henryindeed I didn't."	"doyle"
"I observed it as you entered the room, said Holmes."	"doyle"
"I have some recollection, Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some ability during the investigation."	"doyle"
"The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window."	"doyle"
"Do you see anything there?"	"doyle"
"My name is Dr. Watson."	"doyle"
"My wife is expecting me."	"doyle"
"Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that night."	"doyle"
"Was ever such bad luck and such bad management, too?"	"doyle"
"It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in Canada."	"doyle"
"The little detective smiled."	"doyle"
"Holmes considered for a little time."	"doyle"
"We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having exposed you to this fright."	"doyle"
"The dog's jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff."	"doyle"
"Far away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady yellow light was shining."	"doyle"
"And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as that."	"doyle"
"I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor."	"doyle"
"We were just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall, black-bearded figure, his shoulders rounded, as he tip-toed down the passage."	"doyle"
"The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt."	"doyle"
"I cannot doubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this fashion, and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous man."	"doyle"
"Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in."	"doyle"
"I have myself seen this old man cross the Grimpen Mire by the path which Stapleton had marked out."	"doyle"
"In your opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for a Baskervillethat is your opinion?"	"doyle"
"Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their situation, and it was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there, but Stapleton would not hear of it."	"doyle"
"Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon his knee."	"doyle"
"There's our man, Watson!"	"doyle"
"Holmes shrugged his shoulders."	"doyle"
"I did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband."	"doyle"
"And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with Sir Charles?"	"doyle"
"She turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, while I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to Baskerville Hall."	"doyle"
"A faint moaning and rustling came from within."	"doyle"
"You will visit each of these in turn."	"doyle"
"Her dry lips could not speak the No which I saw rather than heard."	"doyle"
"What do you make of it?"	"doyle"
"On its jagged face was spread-eagled some dark, irregular object."	"doyle"
"Chapter 6 Baskerville Hall Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the appointed day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire."	"doyle"
"That then should be the centre of my search."	"doyle"
"In an instant Holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to the man of action."	"doyle"
"And so it was arranged."	"doyle"
"To go to Baskerville Hall."	"doyle"
"Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was out of sight."	"doyle"
"Perhaps in my next I may be able to throw some light upon this also."	"doyle"
"Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared to the chance of having your throat cut."	"doyle"
"I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country."	"doyle"
"And what is your theory of this poor fellow's death?"	"doyle"
"At last she looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner."	"doyle"
"I have nothing in the world against you, my good man, said Holmes."	"doyle"
"But I have only just come."	"doyle"
"He's been out three days now, and the warders watch every road and every station, but they've had no sight of him yet."	"doyle"
"But, first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the other factors in the situation."	"doyle"
"I have no doubt, for example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in effigy to-night."	"doyle"
"He distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her."	"doyle"
"It puts him in the power of the cabman."	"doyle"
"But now I see that I was never anything but a tool in his hands."	"doyle"
"Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under this roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot against me."	"doyle"
"Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him."	"doyle"
"And so did I, said Baskerville."	"doyle"
"The sending of this letter was suggested to you by Stapleton?"	"doyle"
"And then at last I heard him."	"doyle"
"This man was far from the place where the latter had disappeared."	"doyle"
"From this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building, from which all the bedrooms opened."	"doyle"
"There is a complete absence of motive."	"doyle"
"In that impassive, colourless man, with his straw hat and his butterfly-net, I seemed to see something terriblea creature of infinite patience and craft, with a smiling face and a murderous heart."	"doyle"
"But this is marvellous."	"doyle"
"Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer."	"doyle"
"It might be his portrait."	"doyle"
"A touch, Watsonan undeniable touch!"	"doyle"
"Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed always by Stapleton in the cab."	"doyle"
"I fancy the Yew Alley, though not marked under that name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon the right of it."	"doyle"
"He did, as a matter of fact, marry, and had one child, this fellow, whose real name is the same as his father's."	"doyle"
"In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy."	"doyle"
"In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that cat-like love of personal cleanliness which was one of his characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he were in Baker Street."	"doyle"
"No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft."	"doyle"
"I prayed, as I walked back along the gray, lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders."	"doyle"
"So furious was he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning."	"doyle"
"He frightened me into remaining silent."	"doyle"
"Chapter 2 The Curse of the Baskervilles I have in my pocket a manuscript, said Dr. James Mortimer."	"doyle"
"We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister's suitoreven when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry."	"doyle"
"Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported."	"doyle"
"Unless I can help you."	"doyle"
"As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry Baskerville himself."	"doyle"
"Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my nerves."	"doyle"
"He asked me to show you up at once when you came."	"doyle"
"How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her?"	"doyle"
"The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a thought."	"doyle"
"Good heavens, Holmes!"	"doyle"
"Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs was waiting."	"doyle"
"He looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air, as one who dreads pursuit."	"doyle"
"The dog he bought in London from Ross and Mangles, the dealers in Fulham Road."	"doyle"
"The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other with surprising dexterity."	"doyle"
"If Stapleton came into the succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the heir, had been living unannounced under another name so close to the property?"	"doyle"
"The differences are obvious."	"doyle"
"He was once a schoolmaster in the north of England."	"doyle"
"A cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological museum."	"doyle"
"Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house while Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville Hall."	"doyle"
"Eventually, as we know, she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand."	"doyle"
"From crime to crime he sank lower and lower, until it is only the mercy of God which has snatched him from the scaffold; but to me, sir, he was always the little curly-headed boy that I had nursed and played with, as an elder sister would."	"doyle"
"I thought as muchand knowing your admirable tenacity I was convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting for the tenant to return."	"doyle"
"The naturalist's angry gestures showed that the lady was included in his displeasure."	"doyle"
"Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his end."	"doyle"
"Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel, he cried."	"doyle"
"If you didn't see him, how do you know he was in the loft?"	"doyle"
"I have not heard him laugh often, and it has always boded ill to somebody."	"doyle"
"She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion."	"doyle"
"We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork, said Dr. Mortimer."	"doyle"
"As our road lay the same way I thought that I would overtake you and introduce myself."	"doyle"
"All right, Barrymore, you can go."	"doyle"
"Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I had the good fortune to help you?"	"doyle"
"Surely you are not going!"	"doyle"
"And you saw no more of him?"	"doyle"
"We after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us."	"doyle"
"It was hard to say whence it came."	"doyle"
"To act the spy upon a friend was a hateful task."	"doyle"
"Somewhere in the heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is forever buried."	"doyle"
"Sir Charles, as is well known, made large sums of money in South African speculation."	"doyle"
"I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves in some business."	"doyle"
"Not more than a mile or two off."	"doyle"
"Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight."	"doyle"
"He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric."	"doyle"
"Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her."	"doyle"
"No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing."	"doyle"
"He may find his way in, but never out, she cried."	"doyle"
"And when she is undeceived?"	"doyle"
"We heard nothing of the kind, said I."	"doyle"
"This case of yours is very complex, Sir Henry."	"doyle"
"In my last report I ended upon my top note with Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you."	"doyle"
"The detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News."	"doyle"
"Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson, come round and lunch with us at two."	"doyle"
"If he were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he would leave his hotel."	"doyle"
"There is only one provision which I must make."	"doyle"
"The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith, while we started to walk to Merripit House."	"doyle"
"Why, Dr. Watson, that's not you, is it?"	"doyle"
"Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that!"	"doyle"
"Welcome to Baskerville Hall!"	"doyle"
"That is true, said Sir Henry."	"doyle"
"We are not much better off to-night."	"doyle"
"Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human beings?"	"doyle"
"But a Times leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have been taken from nothing else."	"doyle"
"Surely you are mistaken about his trade?"	"doyle"
"Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings him all he needs."	"doyle"
"The shadow has departed and will not return."	"doyle"
"Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room except the kitchen?"	"doyle"
"Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line."	"doyle"
"You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson, said he, as he came panting up to where I stood."	"doyle"
"Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you, said the clerk."	"doyle"
"I heard it once before."	"doyle"
"Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked, and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful was the clutch in which it held us."	"doyle"
"Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said: 'It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.'"	"doyle"
"No, no, sir, it is nothingnothing at all!"	"doyle"
"I gave a trifle myself."	"doyle"
"Could this be my stern, self-contained friend?"	"doyle"
"Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water."	"doyle"
"But that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the winds."	"doyle"
"Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket."	"doyle"
"You know it well, then?"	"doyle"
"What was the name that he mentioned?"	"doyle"
"Its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining eyes."	"doyle"
"I shall try my luck some day."	"doyle"
"Yes, my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more."	"doyle"
"Tell me then what it was that you meant, and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry."	"doyle"
"Prehistoric man lived thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived there since, we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them."	"doyle"
"But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up the whole business."	"doyle"
"And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive."	"doyle"
"I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person."	"doyle"
"We have to go, Eliza."	"doyle"
"Why should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her?"	"doyle"
"'Is all ready for Sir Henry?'"	"doyle"
"There was no trace, however, of anything of the kind, nor could I discover any sign which might indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this singular place, save that he must be of Spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life."	"doyle"
"Look at it in this light."	"doyle"
"We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves."	"doyle"
"Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the cabman's reply."	"doyle"
"It is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during all that time."	"doyle"
"All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist."	"doyle"
"I caught one glimpse of his short, squat, strongly- built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run."	"doyle"
"I did a good deal of shopping."	"doyle"
"Among other things I bought these brown bootsgave six dollars for themand had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet."	"doyle"
"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?"	"doyle"
"The records of your detective have reached us here, and you could not celebrate him without being known yourself."	"doyle"
"We cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the difficulty."	"doyle"
"The one is whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime and how was it committed?"	"doyle"
"If the devil did desire to have a hand in the affairs of men  Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation."	"doyle"
"No, said he, I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife brought it up to me."	"doyle"
"The second brother, who died young, is the father of this lad Henry."	"doyle"
"Suppose that it were sosuppose that the same man had been the last who had seen Sir Charles alive, and the first to dog the new heir when he returned to England."	"doyle"
"You are an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in mine, said he."	"doyle"
"It ran: As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor."	"doyle"
"I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day upon their way."	"doyle"
"When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for."	"doyle"
"No doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties."	"doyle"
"You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come to an opinion."	"doyle"
"I think it is the most complete one in the south-west of England."	"doyle"
"Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me away."	"doyle"
"Chapter 10 Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes."	"doyle"
"My popularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to the letter."	"doyle"
"Because it is your post of duty."	"doyle"
"I start then from the day which succeeded that upon which I had established two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons of Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made an appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be found among the stone huts upon the hill-side."	"doyle"
"Beneath it were signed the initials L. L. Have you got that slip?"	"doyle"
"We know that that was the place and hour of his death."	"doyle"
"I will not speak about it just now, but it should make my next report interesting reading."	"doyle"
"You have withheld what the connection is between these events."	"doyle"
"Several rolls of paper lay around him."	"doyle"
"Any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature upon the moor."	"doyle"
"I trust that he is kind to her."	"doyle"
"Two in two days, and many more, perhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather, and never know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches."	"doyle"
"It only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout."	"doyle"
"It must be confessed that the natural explanation offers almost as many difficulties as the other."	"doyle"
"I am sure that he would be delighted."	"doyle"
"And Stapleton, where is he?"	"doyle"
"Here is a copy of the Times."	"doyle"
"His plans were suddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave the Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he himself pretended to coincide."	"doyle"
"Far away came the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone."	"doyle"
"But, dear me, what's this?"	"doyle"
"This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night and the light at the window."	"doyle"
"But he has never let us get together, and it was only to-day for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone."	"doyle"
"My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain forever a mystery."	"doyle"
"My nerves tingled with the sense of adventure."	"doyle"
"To him it may have been an unmitigated relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron."	"doyle"
"It came with the wind through the silence of the night, a long, deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad moan in which it died away."	"doyle"
"The farmers about here don't like it, sir, and that's a fact."	"doyle"
"I'd put him at forty years of age, and he was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir."	"doyle"
"There was certainly no physical injury of any kind."	"doyle"
"He dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the ground."	"doyle"
"It's a very rare birdpractically extinctin England now, but all things are possible upon the moor."	"doyle"
"It's a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting."	"doyle"
"The baronet's face perceptibly lengthened."	"doyle"
"Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk further about this matter in the morning."	"doyle"
"And that was a most vague direction."	"doyle"
"You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir Charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death, but you deny that you kept the appointment."	"doyle"
"My word, it isn't a very cheerful place, said Sir Henry."	"doyle"
"The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery."	"doyle"
"Only a joke, as like as not."	"doyle"
"I could endure it all, ill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long as I could still cling to the hope that I had his love, but now I know that in this also I have been his dupe and his tool."	"doyle"
"He must act at once, or his victim might get beyond his power."	"doyle"
"Not after he went into the station."	"doyle"
"You could easily recognize it, could you not?"	"doyle"
"But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?"	"doyle"
"His dark eyes, glaring out of the white mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from Sir Henry to me."	"doyle"
"I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind."	"doyle"
"My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it."	"doyle"
"I think that we might venture a little farther than this."	"doyle"
"These infernal people seem to think that there are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles."	"doyle"
"Good morning, Holmes, said the baronet."	"doyle"
"I found myself weary and yet wakeful, tossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the sleep which would not come."	"doyle"
"It was for this reason that he took her to London with him."	"doyle"
"I promise you that, said Sherlock Holmes."	"doyle"
"If I am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took in my unhappy situation."	"doyle"
"Mrs. Lyons, said I, as I rose from this long and inconclusive interview, you are taking a very great responsibility and putting yourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean breast of all that you know."	"doyle"
"Come in here, Watson!"	"doyle"
"I had a school, said Stapleton."	"doyle"
"Her initials were L. L. How do you know this, Barrymore?"	"doyle"
"A glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment."	"doyle"
"I will do just what you say."	"doyle"
"We must wish you good-morning now, Mrs. Lyons, and it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again."	"doyle"
"There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry, he answered."	"doyle"
"It was a sweet, simple country spot, but I was surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms, who leaned upon their short rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed."	"doyle"
"Out by the Cleft Tor, I think."	"doyle"
"I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when the position of affairs is made clear to her."	"doyle"
"Holmes's face was turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift."	"doyle"
"He is not a man with intimate friends."	"doyle"
"The boy was nowhere to be seen."	"doyle"
"No, we have no news of any kind, said Dr. Mortimer in answer to my friend's questions."	"doyle"
"Come now, Watson, didn't you think yourself that it was the cry of a hound?"	"doyle"
"The past and the present are within the field of my inquiry, but what a man may do in the future is a hard question to answer."	"doyle"
"If on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us, this was at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely share it."	"doyle"
"Suppose that there were really some huge hound loose upon it; that would go far to explain everything."	"doyle"
"This explanation was borne out by the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing organic disease, and the coroner's jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence."	"doyle"
"The fact is no longer a secret."	"doyle"
"Among the old houses on the hillsidethe stone huts where the old folk used to live."	"doyle"
"Yes, the setting is a worthy one."	"doyle"
"With rows of flaring torches to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet, it might have softened; but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one's voice became hushed and one's spirit subdued."	"doyle"
"I realized it as I drove back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people."	"doyle"
"If you will wait, one or other of us will go back with you to the Hall."	"doyle"
"I would not lose that stick for the world."	"doyle"
"I found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel."	"doyle"
"And a man of precise mind, evidently."	"doyle"
"And now there's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel."	"doyle"
"It cost me 200 pounds, but I got my verdict."	"doyle"
"With a wood round it?"	"doyle"
"The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes."	"doyle"
"By his cries he must have run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track."	"doyle"
"Between us we soon supplied his wants, and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should know."	"doyle"
"There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the latter not a very strong man."	"doyle"
"And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon her."	"doyle"
"Get into this hollow, Lestrade."	"doyle"
"I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent, for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent I asked him casually to what type Frankland's skull belonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive."	"doyle"
"I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this important information."	"doyle"
"If you hold these views, why have you come to consult me at all?"	"doyle"
"What can I tell you about him?"	"doyle"
"What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge."	"doyle"
"In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes, bounding after its victim."	"doyle"
"My brother and I were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles."	"doyle"
"About four feet high."	"doyle"
"How could he have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?"	"doyle"
"But are you sure of this, Holmes?"	"doyle"
"With her perfect figure and elegant dress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path."	"doyle"
"Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from memory."	"doyle"
"And one more question, Dr. Mortimer."	"doyle"
"I must get back, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you."	"doyle"
"My footprint, I presume?"	"doyle"
"He gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers."	"doyle"
"And yet, consider that every Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate."	"doyle"
"Well, you see the hills beyond?"	"doyle"
"As I set it down again, after having examined it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it."	"doyle"
"He looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear, starlit night."	"doyle"
"How can he see the guiding wands to-night?"	"doyle"
"We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any possibility he might be in London."	"doyle"
"He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her."	"doyle"
"The odds are enormously against your finding it."	"doyle"
"Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and flushed with his exertions."	"doyle"
"Barrymore asked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in his study some little time."	"doyle"
"I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone outside, his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features."	"doyle"
"Really, sir, this is a very extraordinary question."	"doyle"
"We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be of such intense interest to us."	"doyle"
"We are dealing with a clever man, Watson."	"doyle"
"It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so."	"doyle"
"It was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim, hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly intolerant eye."	"doyle"
"Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient gesture."	"doyle"
"Closed and padlocked."	"doyle"
"There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of detectives is helpless."	"doyle"
"How can you say that?"	"doyle"
"The moon shone clear above them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach her own home."	"doyle"
"Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother."	"doyle"
"We'll teach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners, confound them!"	"doyle"
"You don't mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?"	"doyle"
"He was a remarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, with a square black beard and pale, distinguished features."	"doyle"
"The queerest perhaps said Holmes, thoughtfully."	"doyle"
"We hope very soon to return to Devonshire."	"doyle"
"Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now at last it came to my aid."	"doyle"
"No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do it."	"doyle"
"Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance."	"doyle"
"That's lucky for himin fact, it's lucky for all of you, since you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter."	"doyle"
"No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire to-night."	"doyle"
"Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair."	"doyle"
"It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson, said a well-known voice."	"doyle"
"I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal emotion."	"doyle"
"Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand."	"doyle"
"cried Dr. Mortimer, what is this?"	"doyle"
"You don't believe such nonsense as that?"	"doyle"
"There are two questions waiting for us at the outset."	"doyle"
"I remembered how the baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to Barrymore."	"doyle"
"He might slip away from us in the crowd of Regent Street, but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor."	"doyle"
"That cold, incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world."	"doyle"
"His agitation was so great that he could hardly speak, and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle."	"doyle"
"No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no word of it."	"doyle"
"I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier still, for I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive."	"doyle"
"The total value of the estate was close on to a million."	"doyle"
"I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has brought nothing but trouble here!"	"doyle"
"Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady."	"doyle"
"Well, then, why this hound should be loose to-night."	"doyle"
"Is it possible that I am really in danger from so dark a cause?"	"doyle"
"But in any case I feel that the money should go with the title and estate."	"doyle"
"Are you sure of what you say?"	"doyle"
"The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an impression might easily have been erroneous."	"doyle"
"You'll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child."	"doyle"
"That was all which I intended to convey."	"doyle"
"It appears to be a statement of some sort."	"doyle"
"The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family."	"doyle"
"His dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke."	"doyle"
"We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor."	"doyle"
"Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name."	"doyle"
"No, sir, indeed I have not."	"doyle"
"We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting neighbours."	"doyle"
"See how he has treated me!"	"doyle"
"He can't be very long, now."	"doyle"
"How could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry?"	"doyle"
"Already our man had gone round the gallery, and the corridor was all in darkness."	"doyle"

"Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?"	"doyle"
"And so could Ifrom which I gather that in all probability it was a false one."	"doyle"
"But why this elaborate deception?"	"doyle"
"We dare not take the chance of his being overtaken before he can reach us."	"doyle"
"You tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me to do it."	"doyle"
"There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an influence over her which may have been love or may have been fear, or very possibly both, since they are by no means incompatible emotions."	"doyle"
"Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied, so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever."	"doyle"
"Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free woman."	"doyle"

"One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last."	"doyle"

"I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer's belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found."	"doyle"

"From Charing Cross Hospital?"	"doyle"
"Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the baronet's teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us."	"doyle"
"He must be near his light."	"doyle"
"He did not pause, however, but bounded onward."	"doyle"
"He might throw some light on that which is so dark to us."	"doyle"
"The gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim."	"doyle"
"It's the mud settling, or the water rising, or something."	"doyle"
"Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path."	"doyle"
"It was the sob of a woman, the muffled, strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow."	"doyle"
"There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled."	"doyle"

"The freckles started out on the lady's face."	"doyle"

"He would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the present owner, who can, of course, do what he likes with it."	"doyle"
"Whichever it is, my answer is fixed."	"doyle"

"I fear that Watson and I must go to London."	"doyle"
"That should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his post in Devonshire or not."	"doyle"
"Well, I'm glad to hear you say so, said Sir Henry, glancing with some surprise at my friend."	"doyle"
"I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office."	"doyle"
"Is this true, Barrymore?"	"doyle"
"We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here."	"doyle"
"On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor."	"doyle"
"Did you answer it yourself?"	"doyle"
"It is my business, and not yours."	"doyle"
"I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes him his food."	"doyle"
"What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer?"	"doyle"
"You say that your fare told you that he was a detective?"	"doyle"
"The second: Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry, to report unable to trace cut sheet of Times.CARTWRIGHT."	"doyle"
"We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house, but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it."	"doyle"
"Besides, besides  Why do you hesitate?"	"doyle"
"But suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his lips parted in amazement."	"doyle"
"The house is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and then to show the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver veins upon the sides of the hills, and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces."	"doyle"
"There are two moorland farmers."	"doyle"
"The dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before."	"doyle"
"But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?"	"doyle"
"It was in the north country."	"doyle"
"What would you recommend?"	"doyle"
"The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him."	"doyle"

"We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front door."	"doyle"
"I alighted and sent a message to Sir Henry that I should walk over in time for dinner."	"doyle"
"If you have heard anything of my unhappy history you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it."	"doyle"
"A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean."	"doyle"
"I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing."	"doyle"
"It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir Henry's attire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he might always have the means of setting him upon his track."	"doyle"
"They have always been together, and according to his account he has been a very lonely man with only her as a companion, so that the thought of losing her was really terrible to him."	"doyle"

"Now, look here, Mr. Holmes, it's half-past eleven now and I am going back right away to my hotel."	"doyle"

"Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me."	"doyle"
"Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my occupation."	"doyle"

"Have you among your neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a black, full beard?"	"doyle"

"What was it you wanted to ask, sir?"	"doyle"
"You mean that the thing is supernatural?"	"doyle"

"The hound had kept upon the grassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track but the man's was visible."	"doyle"
"She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that she would never be happy until I had left it."	"doyle"
"But these, of course, are after-thoughts."	"doyle"
"That Sir Henry should have been exposed to this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case, but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice."	"doyle"
"Well, what happened when you did get there?"	"doyle"
"The baronet's nerves were still quivering from that cry, which recalled the dark story of his family, and he was not in the mood for fresh adventures."	"doyle"
"What have I withheld?"	"doyle"
"I tell you, Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel."	"doyle"

"To walk across the moor?"	"doyle"

"You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s and the short."	"doyle"
"I am conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending dangerever present danger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define it."	"doyle"
"I stayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of action."	"doyle"
"His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take a cab he was all ready to follow them."	"doyle"
"As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost our man."	"doyle"
"The more outre and grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined, and the very point which appears to complicate a case is, when duly considered and scientifically handled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it."	"doyle"
"I thought that a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a new man."	"doyle"
"The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows."	"doyle"
"It's the pet story of the family, though I never thought of taking it seriously before."	"doyle"
"And he left five years agothe date is on the stick."	"doyle"
"If this man were inside it I should find out from his own lips, at the point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had dogged us so long."	"doyle"
"He would be very angry if he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry to go away."	"doyle"
"A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen."	"doyle"
"Yes, I examined myself."	"doyle"
"But you will come on, will you not, and see Merripit House?"	"doyle"
"I had not even time to put on my hat."	"doyle"
"It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he might have a refuge."	"doyle"
"And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor."	"doyle"
"Surely we have a case."	"doyle"
"There's no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the date, 1647, are on the back of the canvas."	"doyle"
"It is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able to do it."	"doyle"
"He had not understood, he said, that I was becoming attached to her, but when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so, and that she might be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did."	"doyle"
"I have always felt that there was something singular and questionable in this man's character, but the adventure of last night brings all my suspicions to a head."	"doyle"
"It must be our first duty to see herboth of usto-morrow."	"doyle"
"The old man put on a very knowing expression."	"doyle"

"Holmes laid his hand upon my arm."	"doyle"
"A half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds."	"doyle"
"Might I trouble you for itthe inside page, please, with the leading articles?"	"doyle"

"There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to help me."	"doyle"
"Sir Henry's falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir Henry."	"doyle"
"Those shots must have told him that the game was up."	"doyle"
"It was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor, with no sign of life near itjust the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it."	"doyle"
"But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the Times with some holes cut in it with scissors."	"doyle"
"A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day."	"doyle"
"It's all these goings-on, sir, he cried at last, waving his hand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor."	"doyle"
"I have a good mind to go to London with you, said the baronet."	"doyle"
"All afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and thought."	"doyle"
"Of course we know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the brute overtook him."	"doyle"
"Was he the agent of others or had he some sinister design of his own?"	"doyle"
"It has, however, one obvious disadvantage."	"doyle"
"He would not do anything so mad, sir."	"doyle"
"I wish you to drive to Merripit House."	"doyle"
"It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was clear that in spite of Holmes's ruse we had no proof that Barrymore had not been in London all the time."	"doyle"
"There was certainly no boot in it then."	"doyle"
"Capital article this on free trade."	"doyle"
"To right and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite."	"doyle"
"The light is a signal to him that food is ready for him, and his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it."	"doyle"
"Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders."	"doyle"
"I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way which earned his approval."	"doyle"
"Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel."	"doyle"
"He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods."	"doyle"
"With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed."	"doyle"
"Then I followed Frankland into his dining-room."	"doyle"
"His connection with the Stapletons can be traced for several years, as far back as the schoolmastering days, so that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and wife."	"doyle"
"Do none suggest themselves?"	"doyle"
"Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men."	"doyle"
"Do I understand you to say that you have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in London?"	"doyle"
"Why, you look very serious over it."	"doyle"
"The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the hill, and the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one side and gray shadow on the other."	"doyle"
"So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it."	"doyle"

"One great gray bird, a gull or curlew, soared aloft in the blue heaven."	"doyle"
"The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon the flat leads of the house."	"doyle"
"I told you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again, that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel."	"doyle"
"It's no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such a place as this, said he."	"doyle"
"I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me, said he."	"doyle"
"It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light."	"doyle"
"I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind, said he; but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that note is concerned."	"doyle"
"You say it was large?"	"doyle"
"Last night, about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room."	"doyle"
"cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol."	"doyle"
"In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one."	"doyle"
"I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the late Sir Charles Baskerville, said he."	"doyle"
"Look at the great trench in the opposite hill."	"doyle"
"In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think."	"poe"
"And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death."	"poe"
"His vesture was dabbled in bloodand his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror."	"poe"
"It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his side."	"poe"
"The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men."	"poe"
"In truth the masquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince's indefinite decorum."	"poe"
"His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre."	"poe"
"But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious."	"poe"
"It was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence."	"poe"
"But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life."	"poe"
"When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys."	"poe"
"There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers."	"poe"
"But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held."	"poe"
"There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine."	"poe"
"All these and security were within."	"poe"
"The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure."	"poe"
"With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion."	"poe"
"The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat."	"poe"
"But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments."	"poe"
"But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death."	"poe"
"The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple."	"poe"
"And the flames of the tripods expired."	"poe"
"Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask, which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form."	"poe"
"Seize him and unmask himthat we may know whom we have to hang, at sunrise, from the battlements!"	"poe"
"And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay."	"poe"
"He had a fine eye for colours and effects."	"poe"
"But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel."	"poe"
"There are some who would have thought him mad."	"poe"
"And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances."	"poe"
"The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts."	"poe"
"The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave."	"poe"
"There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion."	"poe"
"The third was green throughout, and so were the casements."	"poe"
"Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation."	"poe"
"But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before."	"poe"
"Who dares,he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near himwho dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery?"	"poe"
"But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room."	"poe"
"But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince's person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purplethrough the purple to the greenthrough the green to the orangethrough this again to the whiteand even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him."	"poe"
"There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect."	"poe"
"When the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which, with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage."	"poe"
"The panes here were scarleta deep blood colour."	"poe"
"And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an hour."	"poe"
"And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before."	"poe"
"The tastes of the duke were peculiar."	"poe"
"The abbey was amply provisioned."	"poe"
"There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments."	"poe"
"The Red Death had long devastated the country."	"poe"
"They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly, for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand."	"poe"
"Without was the Red Death."	"poe"
"At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker."	"poe"
"A strong and lofty wall girdled it in."	"poe"
"And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods."	"poe"
"To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams."	"poe"
"He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer."	"poe"
"There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasmmuch of what has been since seen in Hernani."	"poe"
"The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed."	"poe"
"In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation."	"poe"
"And the rumour of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprisethen, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust."	"poe"
"In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded."	"poe"
"He disregarded the decora of mere fashion."	"poe"

"Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned herJames is so obliged to you!"	"austen"
"I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home."	"austen"
"Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, She certainly is handsome; she is better than handsome!"	"austen"
"There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce somethingOffices for the salenot quite of human fleshbut of human intellect."	"austen"
"Emma began to listen better."	"austen"
"She would catch a dreadful cold."	"austen"
"Pretty well, my dearI hopepretty well.I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably."	"austen"
"Randalls is such a distance."	"austen"
"She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident."	"austen"
"But she had believed them to be well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion?"	"austen"
"How do you do, Miss Smith?Very well I thank you.And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding."	"austen"
"He had returned to a late dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over."	"austen"
"Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her."	"austen"
"He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes."	"austen"
"Was not she the whole day with you?"	"austen"
"She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any of mama's children ever were."	"austen"
"And I have no doubt that he will thrive, and be a very rich man in timeand his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us."	"austen"
"Nobody could be so imprudent!"	"austen"
"She paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a Well, well, and was at last forced to add, Is it a good letter?"	"austen"
"Jane!repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure.That is easybut Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I suppose."	"austen"
"She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself."	"austen"
"He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment."	"austen"
"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction."	"austen"
"Not heard of you!I believe Mrs. Weston's letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton."	"austen"
"It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as you think me already."	"austen"
"The son looked convinced."	"austen"
"You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed."	"austen"
"He reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window seatsbut he reads all them to himself."	"austen"
"But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going inobserving, as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax."	"austen"
"He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he only said, I shall not scold you."	"austen"
"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over, said Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them into the lane again."	"austen"
"Yes, sometimes he can."	"austen"
"One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,the ball at the Crown."	"austen"
"E. is Knightley's right hand."	"austen"
"A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury."	"austen"
"The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the infant's appearing not quite well."	"austen"
"If it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house."	"austen"
"Here have I, said she, actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man."	"austen"
"You must take care of yourself, Mrs. Elton.This letter tells usit is a short letterwritten in a hurry, merely to give us noticeit tells us that they are all coming up to town directly, on Mrs. Churchill's accountshe has not been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for herso they are all to move southward without loss of time."	"austen"
"And she appears so truly goodthere is something so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one directly."	"austen"
"I was reading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to hera letter from Janethat she can never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under my huswifeand since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says;but, first of all, I really must, in justice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letteronly two pages you seehardly twoand in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half."	"austen"
"Miss Bates said a great deal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding; Mr. Knightley's answer was the most distinct."	"austen"
"dear; I was so miserable!"	"austen"
"A mind like hers, once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress."	"austen"
"I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next."	"austen"
"He must have a pretty good opinion of himself."	"austen"
"There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble to check them, extraordinary as they were."	"austen"
"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not feel that I had done wrong."	"austen"
"Such a fortnight as it has been!"	"austen"
"Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary, indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him."	"austen"
"The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest."	"austen"
"think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend!"	"austen"
"And here I can admit, that my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable."	"austen"
"Such an immense plantation all round it!"	"austen"
"What a thinking brain you have!"	"austen"
"So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill!"	"austen"
"No invitation came amiss to her."	"austen"
"His appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now."	"austen"
"With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin, and there was evidently no dislike to it."	"austen"
"Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable!"	"austen"
"Though I think he had better not have married."	"austen"
"Yes: but a young ladya brideI ought to have paid my respects to her if possible."	"austen"
"I do not want to say more than is necessaryI am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and I dare say you understand me."	"austen"
"I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."	"austen"
"you are too scrupulous, indeed you are, cried Emma warmly, and taking her hand."	"austen"
"The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy."	"austen"
"Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper."	"austen"
"The man must be a blockhead who wanted more."	"austen"
"Married women, you know, may be safely authorised."	"austen"
"I can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation."	"austen"
"What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,espionage, and treachery?To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to judge us all!Here have we been, the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear.They must take the consequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!"	"austen"
"I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me your opinion."	"austen"
"She thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest."	"austen"
"And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates."	"austen"
"Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?He will have a hot walk."	"austen"
"Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account, which she could not give any sincere explanation of."	"austen"
"It must be a severe trial to them all."	"austen"
"So I begged he would notfor really as to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great many leftit was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same."	"austen"
"I am rather proud of little George."	"austen"
"and John, how are you?"	"austen"
"She often says, when the letter is first opened, 'Well, Hetty, now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'don't you, ma'am?And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for herevery word of itI am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word."	"austen"
"No; he thought it very far from an improvementa very bad planmuch worse than the other."	"austen"
"I want to have your opinion of her looks."	"austen"
"I knew you would wish it."	"austen"
"It ought to be a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me."	"austen"
"go to-day, go to-day."	"austen"
"But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world."	"austen"
"Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her brother-in-law's breaking out."	"austen"
"What were nine miles to a young man?An hour's ride."	"austen"
"This is a matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry."	"austen"
"That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations."	"austen"
"Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked."	"austen"
"Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment."	"austen"
"here's Miss Woodhouse.Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?Very well I thank you, quite well."	"austen"
"This is the luxury of a large party, said she:one can get near every body, and say every thing."	"austen"
"It is a necessary of life to me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice."	"austen"
"She was quite one of her worthiesthe most amiable, affable, delightful womanjust as accomplished and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered."	"austen"
"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"They were a couple worth looking at."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself."	"austen"
"His ostensible reason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made up in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield."	"austen"
"He knew nothing about it, Emma."	"austen"
"He listened in perfect silence."	"austen"
"She could not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintiveMr."	"austen"
"He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added, She ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may be.To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet."	"austen"
"Emma continued, I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity."	"austen"
"He did not know what they had best do."	"austen"
"He is a most charming young man."	"austen"
"Her affection must have overpowered her judgment."	"austen"
"CHAPTER XVI The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think and be miserable.It was a wretched business indeed!Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!Such a blow for Harriet!that was the worst of all."	"austen"
"Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different."	"austen"
"Dating from three o'clock yesterday."	"austen"
"if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!Good-bye, good-bye."	"austen"
"This sensation of listlessness, weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself, this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!"	"austen"
"I hope we shall have her here next week."	"austen"
"I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper."	"austen"
"And now we shall just miss them; too provoking!I do not know when I have been so disappointed."	"austen"
"An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome."	"austen"
"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense."	"austen"
"And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly."	"austen"
"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing!"	"austen"
"Emma could not help laughing as she answered, Upon my word, I believe you know her quite as well as I do.But, Mr. Knightley, are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him."	"austen"
"a man does not imagine any such thing."	"austen"
"If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!and upon its beginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation."	"austen"
"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend Mr. Dixon in them."	"austen"
"You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of friendship."	"austen"
"A fine place, but very retired."	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bearand here would be a ninthand Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party."	"austen"
"as for me, my judgment is worth nothing."	"austen"
"We were speaking the other day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves, for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company."	"austen"
"But with all the hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet, as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease."	"austen"
"What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton?"	"austen"
"My regard for Hartfield is most warm He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance?"	"austen"
"The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side, and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before."	"austen"
"And secretly she added to herself, Lord bless me!"	"austen"
"I agree with you exactly."	"austen"
"It was all right, all open, all equal."	"austen"
"His wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed."	"austen"
"I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument at her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence."	"austen"
"Was he handsome?She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man."	"austen"
"you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?I was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us."	"austen"
"If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.Of the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F, who would never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to."	"austen"
"She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined."	"austen"
"But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge!"	"austen"
"Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill, which always interested her."	"austen"
"One takes up a notion, and runs away with it."	"austen"
"Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer."	"austen"
"Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!"	"austen"
"Well, said the still waiting Harriet;wellandand what shall I do?"	"austen"
"Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she was herself struck by his warmth."	"austen"
"John does not even mention your friend, said Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud."	"austen"
"To be sure, said Harriet, in a mortified voice, he is not so genteel as real gentlemen."	"austen"
"He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but Emma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character."	"austen"
"But it should be so no more."	"austen"
"Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her."	"austen"
"She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by representing that though he certainly would make them nine, yet he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very immaterial."	"austen"
"It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very indifferentwhich, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well, and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with."	"austen"
"But she could never get acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reservesuch apparent indifference whether she pleased or notand then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!and she was made such a fuss with by every body!and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimatebecause their ages were the same, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other."	"austen"
"Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?"	"austen"
"I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account."	"austen"
"We really must wish you good night."	"austen"
"The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner."	"austen"
"If it were admissible to contradict a lady, said the gallant Mr. Elton I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before."	"austen"
"She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased to see that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses, having little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and independence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as he could, and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey."	"austen"
"Knightley's words dwelt with her."	"austen"
"I do remember it, cried Emma; I perfectly remember it.Talking about spruce-beer.Oh!"	"austen"
"But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do."	"austen"
"He had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he was to be at home by the middle of the day."	"austen"
"You divert me against my conscience."	"austen"
"They would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season of the year."	"austen"
"'My dear,' said I, 'I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:' but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room."	"austen"
"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning."	"austen"
"Emma hung about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?He would not deny that he did, she was sure.Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his letters, who so glad to assist him?Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?Would not he like to have him always on the spot?Yes."	"austen"
"She had frequently thoughtespecially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylorthat if she were to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition."	"austen"
"Harriet was remembered only from being her friend."	"austen"
"If it were love, it might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone."	"austen"
"asked Mrs. Ford.Yesnoyes, to Mrs. Goddard's."	"austen"
"Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace for herself."	"austen"
"He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills."	"austen"
"Encouragement should be given."	"austen"
"How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates?"	"austen"
"Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that you were too late for the best strawberries."	"austen"
"I think Harriet is doing extremely well."	"austen"
"I will attack them with more address."	"austen"
"But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!"	"austen"
"But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea."	"austen"
"The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably."	"austen"
"I like a job of that sort excessively.'"	"austen"
"She promised him again and again to comemuch oftener than he doubtedand was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it."	"austen"
"Jane did not look round."	"austen"
"The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself."	"austen"
"Whether he were overhearing too, she could not determine."	"austen"
"Mrs. Goddard's school was in high reputeand very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands."	"austen"
"Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have done his business."	"austen"
"You would not think it to look at him, but he is biliousMr."	"austen"
"I'd rather you would."	"austen"
"But while so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax."	"austen"
"They, in their different homes, and their different ways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than any she had ever passed."	"austen"
"Well, said she at last, trying to recover herself; this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at all comprehend it."	"austen"
"If she has fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very sorryextremely sorryBut, Miss Smith, indeed!Oh!"	"austen"
"She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired."	"austen"
"No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him off, he did not;but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and a very agreeable evening we had."	"austen"
"This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry."	"austen"
"At first, if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater disparity (those were your very words);I should not have dared to give way toI should not have thought it possibleBut if you, who had been always acquainted with him Harriet!"	"austen"
"had she never brought Harriet forward!"	"austen"
"Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added, Oh no!"	"austen"
"That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance!"	"austen"
"Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.Emma knew that he had, on that occasion, found her much superior to his expectation."	"austen"
"She went on, however."	"austen"
"As a walking companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her."	"austen"
"Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years."	"austen"
"You know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us."	"austen"
"I feel it so very due."	"austen"
"Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistakenmore in errormore disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself."	"austen"
"The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama."	"austen"
"CHAPTER XI Harriet, poor Harriet!Those were the words; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted the real misery of the business to her."	"austen"
"Your meaning must be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will present themselves unbidden to your mind, I am persuaded."	"austen"
"She believed every body found his manners pleasing."	"austen"
"Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must be a lady in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston told me you were here.Oh!"	"austen"
"My dear, you do not understand me."	"austen"
"She was then obliged to be finished, and make her appearance."	"austen"
"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot."	"austen"
"Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine."	"austen"
"After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard's hands to shift as she can;to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance."	"austen"
"They had gone, in shortand very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady."	"austen"
"I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth, shan't I?"	"austen"
"my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!And it is a kindness to employ our men."	"austen"
"You had, somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own management; but to-day you are got back againand as I cannot be always with you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine."	"austen"
"At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings."	"austen"
"Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove."	"austen"
"From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a disengaged day!A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have been at a loss."	"austen"
"A whole evening of back-gammon with her father, was felicity to it."	"austen"
"She did not really like her."	"austen"
"I can have no self-command without a motive."	"austen"
"I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must be a great drawback."	"austen"
"Had he said any thing to bear a different construction, I should not have believed him."	"austen"
"Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold."	"austen"
"It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen, before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's feelings."	"austen"
"No, indeed, cried Emma, most happy to begin, not in the least."	"austen"
"I really am ashamed of always leading the way."	"austen"
"Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing."	"austen"
"The picture!How eager he had been about the picture!and the charade!and an hundred other circumstances;how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston added, that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon."	"austen"
"Did not you observe her manner of answering me?"	"austen"
"Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill."	"austen"
"It was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade."	"austen"
"Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful."	"austen"
"no, I could not endure William Coxea pert young lawyer."	"austen"
"I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight."	"austen"
"The anxious cares, the incessant attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away."	"austen"
"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.If one leads you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it."	"austen"
"June will soon be here."	"austen"
"CHAPTER XVII Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield."	"austen"
"Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowdand a crowd in a little room!"	"austen"
"A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity."	"austen"
"'Well,' said she, 'it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.'"	"austen"
"Emma had not been thinking of him, she had forgotten to think of himbut she was very glad to see him."	"austen"
"But it is impossible not to feel uneasiness."	"austen"
"You know nothing of drawing."	"austen"
"Mr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution."	"austen"
"I think her beautiful, quite beautiful."	"austen"
"He saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and demure."	"austen"
"He had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty."	"austen"
"He could not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her."	"austen"
"CHAPTER XIII The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at Hartfieldbut in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was summer again."	"austen"
"What an amiable creature I was!No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance."	"austen"
"No, it was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough."	"austen"
"Emma's courage returned, and she walked on."	"austen"
"I wish you could have heard how she talked of itwith what candour and generosity."	"austen"
"She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning."	"austen"
"I want you to save yourself from greater pain."	"austen"
"We shall enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish."	"austen"
"Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house, and give her pleasant society again."	"austen"
"Thank you for rousing me, he replied."	"austen"
"The weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy."	"austen"
"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet."	"austen"
"Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied, Never marry!This is a new resolution."	"austen"
"I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married."	"austen"
"Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with her."	"austen"
"She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out."	"austen"
"They had received her doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the timetill just at last, when Mrs. Martin's saying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner."	"austen"
"As she reflected more, she seemed but to feel it more."	"austen"
"She knew a family near Maple Grove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter."	"austen"
"The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand very much in the same wayjust across the lawn; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in mind!"	"austen"
"Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst of them."	"austen"
"When I got to Donwell, said he, Knightley could not be found."	"austen"
"I cannot really change for the better."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston had walked in."	"austen"
"An unpretending, single-minded, artless girlinfinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton."	"austen"
"She is as low as possible."	"austen"
"yes, perfectly.Why do you make a doubt of it?"	"austen"
"Your friend will not take it amiss I hope."	"austen"
"He is so very superior."	"austen"
"the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views!"	"austen"
"He was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better than she had expected."	"austen"
"As the sun is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can."	"austen"
"He said, from the first, it was a very good sortwhich was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint."	"austen"
"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are Very well, I am much obliged to you."	"austen"
"so far off!and the air so bad!"	"austen"
"I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself."	"austen"
"When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of admiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him seated by herand, as she firmly believed, not without some dexterity on his side."	"austen"
"South End is prohibited, if you please."	"austen"
"Jane desired me to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with 'Bless me!"	"austen"
"But she probably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before."	"austen"
"Should she proceed no farther?should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she were totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly resolved.She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once, all that she meant to say and know."	"austen"
"And I hope she will be better off in one respect, and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long."	"austen"
"But you are always kind."	"austen"
"His wife gave him a look which invited him in; and, while he was coming round, added, Now, dearest Emma, let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match."	"austen"
"poor woman, who would have thought it!"	"austen"
"Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce?"	"austen"
"The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates."	"austen"
"You make the best of itbut after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different creatures; you do not look like the same."	"austen"
"she found something else must be done."	"austen"
"His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced."	"austen"
"If she does wrong, she ought to feel it."	"austen"
"They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so impatient to see them againfor till she married, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her motheror her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane's letterwrote in Mr. Dixon's name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy."	"austen"
"no, the meeting is certainly to-day, was the abrupt answer, which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.I do believe, she continued, this is the most troublesome parish that ever was."	"austen"
"You have not heard all that you ought to hear."	"austen"
"Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.In ten minutes, however, the child had been perfectly well again."	"austen"
"If not wise or refined herself, she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of her own set."	"austen"
"The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no pleasures had been lost.But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction."	"austen"
"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for, said he; but I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is, presides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking of?"	"austen"
"She had not been able to speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcomethen reproaching herself for having taken no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too late."	"austen"
"I do not know.One of the Otways.Not Frank;it is not Frank, I assure you."	"austen"
"He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat."	"austen"
"They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates."	"austen"
"She knows I would not offend for the world."	"austen"
"Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her."	"austen"
"They joined company and proceeded together."	"austen"
"Such, for half an hour, was the conversationinterrupted only once by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to inquire if he were comeand she was a little uneasy.She had some fears of his horse."	"austen"
"It is a most repulsive quality, indeed, said he."	"austen"
"But I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point."	"austen"
"And then, her reserveI never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved."	"austen"
"On that article, truth seemed attainable."	"austen"
"Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him."	"austen"
"I have not the smallest doubt of the issue."	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!No, he felt that it ought not to be attempted."	"austen"
"But if I do, I shall be crosser still."	"austen"
"Emma knew it to have been very much the case."	"austen"
"In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon."	"austen"
"It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I cannot believe it."	"austen"
"I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed."	"austen"
"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her.It was the work of a moment."	"austen"
"If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me."	"austen"
"Whenever I see her, she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it."	"austen"
"I shall think you a great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece."	"austen"
"We feel things differently."	"austen"
"Yes, upon my word, very considerable."	"austen"
"and so forthI always felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see."	"austen"
"She could never see a fault in any of them."	"austen"
"By the byeI have not wished you joy."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young man, and I have a great regard for him."	"austen"
"It was felt as such things must be felt."	"austen"
"I wanted them to put off the wedding."	"austen"
"Do you think it will look well?"	"austen"
"With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were now seeing them together for the first time."	"austen"
"You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music."	"austen"
"The last night's ball seemed lost in the gipsies."	"austen"
"Her situation should secure your compassion."	"austen"
"She was sensible of all the affection it evinced."	"austen"
"That it was time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short final arrangement for the next day's scheme, they parted."	"austen"
"Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it was good enough."	"austen"
"I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me ought not to be.'"	"austen"
"Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld."	"austen"
"This would not do; she immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would follow in half a minute."	"austen"
"It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.It led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never had been there."	"austen"
"Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the warmest heart."	"austen"
"I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth."	"austen"
"It is a retired place."	"austen"
"He presently added, with a smile, I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage."	"austen"
"Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity."	"austen"
"But where could you hear it?"	"austen"
"I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart."	"austen"
"She could see nothing but evil in it."	"austen"
"I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us."	"austen"
"It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew olderand even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years henceto have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Westonno one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not have their powers in exercise again."	"austen"
"Had you not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct.I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent."	"austen"
"Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill."	"austen"
"She would be such a delightful companion for Emma."	"austen"
"She must tell you herself what she isyet not by word, for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never complains, I dare not depend."	"austen"
"If this is living in the country, it is nothing very formidable."	"austen"
"They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence."	"austen"
"Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think."	"austen"
"She brought no name, no blood, no alliance."	"austen"
"The young man had been the first admirer, but she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no serious difficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own."	"austen"
"At last Emma attacked her on another ground."	"austen"
"Was he agreeable?He was generally thought so."	"austen"
"The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton."	"austen"
"Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits, which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have escaped her."	"austen"
"He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.Mr."	"austen"
"This gallant young man, who seemed to love without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it."	"austen"
"When had his influence, such influence begun?"	"austen"
"It was but an effusion of lively spirits."	"austen"
"I have no reason to think ill of hernot the leastexcept that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal."	"austen"
"So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, and say, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any more."	"austen"
"Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry's coming.Extraordinary dream, indeed!"	"austen"
"She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement."	"austen"
"Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others."	"austen"
"So they will, my dear."	"austen"
"It was now about the time that she was likely to call."	"austen"
"We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night."	"austen"
"Only give me a carte-blanche.I am Lady Patroness, you know."	"austen"
"It inspired little more than an animating curiosity."	"austen"
"Was it impossible?No.Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.For Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed."	"austen"
"The two eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and staying one whole day at Hartfieldwhich one day would be the very day of this party.His professional engagements did not allow of his being put off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so."	"austen"
"This is what we all feel."	"austen"
"Whom are you going to dance with?"	"austen"
"Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately arranged."	"austen"
"It would hold the very number for comfort."	"austen"
"She liked his open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher character.General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man what he ought to be.She could fancy such a man."	"austen"
"A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate."	"austen"
"I never saw any gentleman's handwritingEmma began, looking also at Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending to some one elseand the pause gave her time to reflect, Now, how am I going to introduce him?Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people?"	"austen"
"So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was younghe wondered he could not remember them!"	"austen"
"It will be felt so great an attention!"	"austen"
"And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right, he made a fuller pause to say, This is very bad.He had induced her to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.She must have had much more to contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could."	"austen"
"His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be different from himself."	"austen"
"Elton, indeed, could not be deniedand Mrs. Cole had made such a pointand Mrs. Perry had said so muchbut, except them, Jane would really see nobody."	"austen"
"What are they saying about Mr. Perry?Has he been here this morning?And how does he travel now?Has he set up his carriage?"	"austen"
"Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any thing that home affords."	"austen"
"We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party."	"austen"
"Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man."	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse was resigned."	"austen"
"Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment."	"austen"
"Every body is asleep!"	"austen"
"I have been walking all this way in complete suspense."	"austen"
"'Dearer, much dearer than ever.'"	"austen"
"One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in upon one's friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs."	"austen"
"That's one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.Well, I declare They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible for her."	"austen"
"She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him, literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before."	"austen"
"A ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change."	"austen"
"A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of."	"austen"
"She means it, I know."	"austen"
"Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most friendly smiles."	"austen"
"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.A sweet, interesting creature."	"austen"
"Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you."	"austen"
"Have you heard the news?"	"austen"
"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs. Weston do not."	"austen"
"The child of good fortune!"	"austen"
"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the misfortune to fall in love with her, or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side."	"austen"
"His extreme attention to my motherwanting her to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my mother is a little deaf, you knowit is not much, but she does not hear quite quick."	"austen"
"To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she found her subject cut upher hand seizedher attention demanded, and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well known, hopingfearingadoringready to die if she refused him; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible."	"austen"
"If you do not call early it will be a slight."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty."	"austen"
"In half a minute they were in the room."	"austen"
"She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any."	"austen"
"Yes, yesbut I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings."	"austen"
"But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place."	"austen"
"You may say what you chusebut your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine."	"austen"
"No, she had had enough of interference."	"austen"
"Do not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon."	"austen"
"The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood."	"austen"
"I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm."	"austen"
"You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted even You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.So cold and artificial!I had always a part to act.It was a life of deceit!I know that I must have disgusted you."	"austen"
"Where could you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley?"	"austen"
"Who is that gentleman on horseback?"	"austen"
"Mr. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, It was time to go; and the young man, though he might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave."	"austen"
"Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact, only too great."	"austen"
"My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question."	"austen"
"'If you must go, my dear,' said I, 'you must, and I will say you are laid down upon the bed.'"	"austen"
"She was most forcibly struck."	"austen"
"You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble herand before her niece, tooand before others, many of whom (certainly some,) would be entirely guided by your treatment of her.This is not pleasant to you, Emmaand it is very far from pleasant to me; but I must, I will,I will tell you truths while I can; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now."	"austen"
"Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;it will be a small party, but where small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any."	"austen"
"I am determined against all interference."	"austen"
"He had done his duty and could return to his son."	"austen"
"It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded."	"austen"
"I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue."	"austen"
"He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady, as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing."	"austen"
"What two letters!express perfection!"	"austen"
"The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort of people, must be doing her harm."	"austen"
"I must order the carriage."	"austen"
"She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable."	"austen"
"He is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;and for an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"So obliged to you!so very much obliged to you for the carriage, resumed Miss Bates."	"austen"
"I sick of prosperity and indulgence!"	"austen"
"No, I fancy not, replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile."	"austen"
"I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you."	"austen"
"The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually before herhe was presented to her, and she did not think too much had been said in his praise; he was a very good looking young man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father's; he looked quick and sensible."	"austen"
"She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness."	"austen"
"The case, you see, is(but this is quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room."	"austen"
"Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty."	"austen"
"Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now."	"austen"
"A crowd in a little roomMiss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving pictures in a few words."	"austen"
"I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to be very frequent."	"austen"
"Good morning to you,said he, rising and walking off abruptly."	"austen"
"So obliged to you for the carriage last night."	"austen"
"In the way of love, I am sure he does not."	"austen"
"He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested."	"austen"
"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield."	"austen"
"Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom."	"austen"
"Knightley is quite the gentleman."	"austen"
"But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded."	"austen"
"But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn."	"austen"
"Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf."	"austen"
"There is no hurry at all."	"austen"
"The house belonged to people in business."	"austen"
"I don't say that it is not a disagreeable businessbut things might be much worse.If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls."	"austen"
"Are you in any doubt as to that?"	"austen"
"You see how delightfully she writes."	"austen"
"Half a minute brought it all out."	"austen"
"Her second duty now, inferior only to her father's claims, was to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match-making."	"austen"
"I am a great dreamer."	"austen"
"The heat overcame me."	"austen"
"Here, resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, here is something still more valuable, I mean that has been more valuable, because this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister never did."	"austen"
"I admire all that quaint, old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease; modern ease often disgusts me."	"austen"
"You do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations."	"austen"
"The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.Mr."	"austen"
"In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas."	"austen"
"There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to What does Weston think of the weather; shall we have rain?"	"austen"
"Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!"	"austen"
"As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her beauty."	"austen"
"He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law."	"austen"
"It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance."	"austen"
"It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be, was beyond his comprehension."	"austen"
"A great deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away."	"austen"
"You are very fond of bending little minds; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones."	"austen"
"The joke, he replied gravely, seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill."	"austen"
"For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible just at present."	"austen"
"No, not now, I thank you."	"austen"
"I do look forward to it, I own, with very great pleasure."	"austen"
"VOLUME II CHAPTER I Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma's opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day."	"austen"
"She would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them."	"austen"
"It was known that they were a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was."	"austen"
"had been a question of his."	"austen"
"My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain, and that you yourself Oh!"	"austen"
"CHAPTER XVIII Time passed on."	"austen"
"Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.She will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.In our communications we deal only in the great.However, I must say, that Robert Martin's heart seemed for him, and to me, very overflowing; and that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy."	"austen"
"Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown."	"austen"
"Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons."	"austen"
"Wellas you please; only don't have a great set out."	"austen"
"I am sure I do not know."	"austen"
"It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health, than on any thing else."	"austen"
"There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it."	"austen"
"But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself."	"austen"
"However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again."	"austen"
"In general, it was a very well approved match."	"austen"
"The public pays and must be served well."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and it would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the table as good for nothing."	"austen"
"Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind."	"austen"
"He had received a good education, but, on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied."	"austen"
"His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet's inclination."	"austen"
"'Do not imagine, madam,' she continued, 'that I was taught wrong."	"austen"
"Within half an hour it was known all over Highbury."	"austen"
"I have been here a week to-morrowhalf my time."	"austen"
"She wished him very well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction."	"austen"
"They could go there again with them in the autumn."	"austen"
"I thoughtbut I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been under a mistake."	"austen"
"At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to."	"austen"
"she is a sweet creature!"	"austen"
"He could now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to all his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill's accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching coldwhich, however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night."	"austen"
"he can see ready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her."	"austen"
"Does not she, Jane?Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?Ah!"	"austen"
"Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home."	"austen"
"Her father never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined."	"austen"
"Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself."	"austen"
"You can borrow Mrs. Cole's."	"austen"
"Well, said she, and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?"	"austen"
"By all means, if you can."	"austen"
"A complete change of life became desirable."	"austen"
"Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury."	"austen"
"But the idea of any thing to be done in a moment, was increasing, not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation."	"austen"
"They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother's place, but without a mother's affection to blind her."	"austen"
"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury."	"austen"
"She must have delighted the Colesworthy people, who deserved to be made happy!And left a name behind her that would not soon die away."	"austen"
"To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls."	"austen"
"I do not believe any such thing, replied Emma.I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent."	"austen"
"When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant glances.The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say, Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?"	"austen"
"said he, 'I can fasten the rivet."	"austen"
"I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known."	"austen"
"At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window, evidently on the watch."	"austen"
"He was not calm; his spirits were evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him."	"austen"
"Jane, you have never seen Mr. Elton!no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him."	"austen"
"The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet."	"austen"
"As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the most irresistible form.His wedding-day was named."	"austen"
"Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us."	"austen"
"I should not wonder, said Mrs. Weston, if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her."	"austen"
"You will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends."	"austen"
"It would be a disappointment to my fatherand altogetherI do not know thatI am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well."	"austen"
"Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some educationand been very well brought up."	"austen"
"Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity."	"austen"
"Pray do not make any more matches."	"austen"
"It could be protracted no longer."	"austen"
"It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him."	"austen"
"Aye, do, Frank.Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at once."	"austen"
"There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one feels for Emma."	"austen"
"Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak."	"austen"
"So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said, 'Shall I go down instead?"	"austen"
"Elton was appealed to.Was not it astonishingly like?She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove."	"austen"
"Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished."	"austen"
"He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was brought her from Randallsa very thick letter;she guessed what it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herselfand as for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.It must be waded through, however."	"austen"
"The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.What had she to wish for?"	"austen"
"She need not trouble herself to pity him."	"austen"
"Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject."	"austen"
"Our part of London is very superior to most others!You must not confound us with London in general, my dear sir."	"austen"
"Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived."	"austen"
"Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;and two basins only were ordered."	"austen"
"From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument."	"austen"
"In all probability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins."	"austen"
"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!"	"austen"
"She merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and soand thought no more of it, till after a minute's silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, I shall never marry."	"austen"
"there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort."	"austen"
"Now,said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened."	"austen"
"A note was written to urge it."	"austen"
"Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no alarming symptoms of love."	"austen"
"She desired nothing better herself."	"austen"
"Well, sir, the time must come when you will be paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great enjoyment."	"austen"
"And this belief produced another dread."	"austen"
"I have often thought them the worst of the two, replied he coolly."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must have some weight."	"austen"
"Here was a dangerous opening."	"austen"
"You are not striving to look taller than any body else."	"austen"
"It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but she was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel itand all that she could hope was, by giving the first information herself, to save her from hearing it abruptly from others."	"austen"
"She would not let Jane say, 'No;' for when Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell's return, and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at presentand so she told Mrs. Elton over and over againand I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did."	"austen"
"You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully."	"austen"
"Why should you caution me?You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston would be at ease."	"austen"
"It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what she felt for him."	"austen"
"She is a standing lesson of how to be happy."	"austen"
"A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.He must be going."	"austen"
"He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven."	"austen"
"I wish her extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object toEvery body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think, quite so much at a loss."	"austen"
"Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.You will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that my uncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels."	"austen"
"And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she must return it by him."	"austen"
"Yes, good man!thought Emmabut what has all that to do with taking likenesses?"	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad to see him every day;but they did see him every day as it was.Why could not they go on as they had done?"	"austen"
"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne."	"austen"
"To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful."	"austen"
"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference."	"austen"
"He was invited on good faith."	"austen"
"She saw, that in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the contrary, she had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant of her own heartand, in short, that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all!"	"austen"
"Where I sit is of no consequence."	"austen"
"Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened."	"austen"
"Only three of us.besides dear Jane at presentand she really eats nothingmakes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it."	"austen"
"It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected."	"austen"
"The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room."	"austen"
"This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection."	"austen"
"Her observation had been pretty correct."	"austen"
"To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay and appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter."	"austen"
"It is only by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as they always are, that you can form any just judgment."	"austen"
"no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind tobut if you would just advise me what I had best doNo, no, I do not mean thatAs you say, one's mind ought to be quite made upOne should not be hesitatingIt is a very serious thing.It will be safer to say 'No,' perhaps.Do you think I had better say 'No?'"	"austen"
"And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope, said Frank Churchill, to join your party and wait for her at Hartfieldif you are going home."	"austen"
"He will be here this evening, I dare say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will pass between us, and you shall not be committed.Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming."	"austen"
"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old."	"austen"
"Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it."	"austen"
"Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma."	"austen"
"He had still a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away."	"austen"
"Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or imagine."	"austen"
"She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say it all."	"austen"
"Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls."	"austen"
"I undertake the commission."	"austen"
"One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.There, the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction."	"austen"
"I told you yesterday, cried Mr. Weston with exultation, I told you all that he would be here before the time named."	"austen"
"If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so, for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the Oh!"	"austen"
"Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber."	"austen"
"What can it possibly be?"	"austen"
"You may be very sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly."	"austen"
"She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration."	"austen"
"Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement, and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friendsfor the house was taken for May and June."	"austen"
"Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin."	"austen"
"Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away, it would be very distressing."	"austen"
"The word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency."	"austen"
"Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope, smiled most graciously."	"austen"
"It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency."	"austen"
"I do not see much sign of it."	"austen"
"They sat down to teathe same party round the same tablehow often it had been collected!and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun!But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive daughter."	"austen"
"'It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I, 'depend upon it."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise."	"austen"
"He did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment."	"austen"
"The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction, took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the picture, which was rapid and happy."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say, and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already."	"austen"
"The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully."	"austen"
"And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again?'"	"austen"
"Harriet's features are very delicate, which makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley is coming too."	"austen"
"It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other."	"austen"
"A man at his agewhat is he?three or four-and-twentycannot be without the means of doing as much as that."	"austen"
"Certain it was that she was to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised itMr."	"austen"
"Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon."	"austen"
"He was often hoping, intending to comebut was always prevented."	"austen"
"If the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am not here, by my grandmama's."	"austen"
"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with."	"austen"
"We may well say that 'our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.'"	"austen"
"Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse, said Miss Bates, four weeks yesterday.A Miss Hawkins!Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts; not that I everMrs."	"austen"
"There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her."	"austen"
"We will go to Hartfield afterwards."	"austen"
"How nicely you talk; I love to hear you."	"austen"
"I do not pretend to be a wit."	"austen"
"He comes to Highbury himself, he says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's."	"austen"
"I could suppose she might in timebut can she already?Did not you misunderstand him?You were both talking of other things; of business, shows of cattle, or new drillsand might not you, in the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?It was not Harriet's hand that he was certain ofit was the dimensions of some famous ox."	"austen"
"A Miss Hawkins of Bath."	"austen"
"Here is his answer, if you like to see it."	"austen"
"He had nestled down his head most conveniently."	"austen"
"I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills' to keep him to themselves."	"austen"
"he continued; every day more precious and more delightful than the day before!every day making me less fit to bear any other place."	"austen"
"He had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known to have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world."	"austen"
"CHAPTER XIII There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister."	"austen"
"If I had followed her judgment, and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.We quarrelled."	"austen"
"However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against yoursand I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife."	"austen"
"Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married."	"austen"
"cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composurethere would have been no danger."	"austen"
"I saw you first in February."	"austen"
"The Churchills are very likely in fault, said Mr. Knightley, coolly; but I dare say he might come if he would."	"austen"
"Isabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest; perhaps hardly so great."	"austen"
"Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates?"	"austen"
"Mrs. Elton then said, Nobody can think less of dress in general than I dobut upon such an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westonswho I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honourI would not wish to be inferior to others."	"austen"
"It opens his designs to his family, it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm prepossession."	"austen"
"He ought to come, said Emma."	"austen"
"He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping them open very inconsiderately."	"austen"
"there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"I need not tell you what is to be done."	"austen"
"Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual followed."	"austen"
"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present, said Mrs. Weston, as can well be; and while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account."	"austen"
"It was foolish, it was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together."	"austen"
"It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world."	"austen"
"I have often known it done myself."	"austen"
"Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had very good reason for saying so."	"austen"
"She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable."	"austen"
"But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge; the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children."	"austen"
"To be sure, so it is."	"austen"
"Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this relicI knew nothing of that till this momentbut the cutting the finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none about me!Oh!"	"austen"
"For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low, Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.Your own excellent senseyour exertions for your father's sakeI know you will not allow yourself."	"austen"
"Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day, with full confidence in their comfort."	"austen"
"I did not see you before."	"austen"
"I remember once calling you 'George,' in one of my amiable fits, about ten years ago."	"austen"
"They will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way."	"austen"
"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of coming."	"austen"
"In fact, it does not concern youit concerns only myself,that is, we hope.Humph!In short, my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it."	"austen"
"Miss Bates was out, which accounted for the previous tranquillity."	"austen"
"I think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings."	"austen"
"And, after proceeding a few steps, she addedI stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you pain.But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplationas a friend, indeed, you may command me.I will hear whatever you like."	"austen"
"But you must have found it very damp and dirty."	"austen"
"You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her."	"austen"
"He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it."	"austen"
"This would soon have led to something better, of course, was her consoling reflection; any thing interests between those who love; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart."	"austen"
"This, you know, speaks a great degree of weaknessbut now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.So Frank writes word."	"austen"
"Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.And her salary!I really cannot venture to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse."	"austen"
"She said no more, other subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few downright silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the othernothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes."	"austen"
"I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.'"	"austen"
"cried Emma, shaking her head.Ah!"	"austen"
"The older a person grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or awkwardness becomes."	"austen"
"There was a communication before her, one which she only could be competent to makethe confession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with it at present.She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well."	"austen"
"They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband also.Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to Highbury."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the benefit of this; I think this would convince you."	"austen"
"But Mr. Elton, in person, had driven away all such cares."	"austen"
"You will see nothing of it by candlelight."	"austen"
"I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible."	"austen"
"Dear Harriet!I would not change you for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing."	"austen"
"Thank you, said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not another syllable followed."	"austen"
"I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion."	"austen"
"It may bring many extenuations."	"austen"
"Such things in general cannot be too short."	"austen"
"It is a very simple story."	"austen"
"no; Perry shall have all the credit."	"austen"
"Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her, therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in arm."	"austen"
"Still, however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment."	"austen"
"There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit."	"austen"
"Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness, and continual observation of, how much he seemed attached!his air as he walked by the housethe very sitting of his hat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!"	"austen"
"No trouble in the world, ma'am, said the obliging Mrs. Ford."	"austen"
"Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be."	"austen"
"I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.He is a very liberal thanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands."	"austen"
"This had happened the year before."	"austen"
"Yes, I understand the sort of mind."	"austen"
"As the door opened she was heard, So very obliging of you!No rain at all."	"austen"
"I never saw such a likeness."	"austen"
"All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure, and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending."	"austen"
"The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax."	"austen"
"He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc."	"austen"
"It was through a series of strange blunders!"	"austen"
"His father would not own himself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare."	"austen"
"The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards."	"austen"
"Emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned."	"austen"
"I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before."	"austen"
"He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted, encouraged attentions.He had gone to learn to be indifferent.But he had gone to a wrong place."	"austen"
"How much I am obliged to you, said he, for telling me to come to-day!If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party."	"austen"
"He had better not be in a hurry."	"austen"
"His mother and sisters were very fond of him."	"austen"
"Emma would be very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c., and they did at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than, How do you do, Mrs. Ford?"	"austen"
"We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before."	"austen"
"Little Emma, grow up a better woman than your aunt."	"austen"
"Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm."	"austen"
"I am going to London, to spend a few days with John and Isabella."	"austen"
"Dear Emma bears every thing so well, said her father."	"austen"
"I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork: when we dress the leg it will be another thing."	"austen"
"He never wished to attach me."	"austen"
"But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of Dixon.Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing."	"austen"
"The word was blunder; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible."	"austen"
"Come, come, cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, I must beg you not to talk of the sea."	"austen"
"Nothing should tempt her to go, if they did; and she regretted that her father's known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish."	"austen"
"No, I do not; that is, I do not meanWhat shall I do?"	"austen"
"Very likely, said Emmanothing more likely."	"austen"
"Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins, was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.The intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural manner."	"austen"
"Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspectbut this is quite between ourselves."	"austen"
"That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,me, of all people, who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas!"	"austen"
"She never had been so depressed."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston, I could not have believed it of you!"	"austen"
"She was, of course, the object of their joint dislike.When they had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived."	"austen"
"Beyond it she would on no account proceed."	"austen"
"After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last month, to Miss Smithsuch attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observingto be addressing me in this mannerthis is an unsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!"	"austen"
"They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if possible."	"austen"
"And how could it possibly come into your head?"	"austen"
"In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one."	"austen"
"The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the happiness of her father."	"austen"
"They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of our carriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well."	"austen"
"She knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet."	"austen"
"Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England."	"austen"
"Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again."	"austen"
"The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.Harriet's parentage became known."	"austen"
"I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold; but I can go into my mother's room you know."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston was disappointed."	"austen"
"My poor mother does not know how to bear it."	"austen"
"They had stopped at Mrs. Bates's door to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons."	"austen"
"But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.My representation, you see, has quite appeased her."	"austen"
"Robert Martin has no great lossif he can but think so; and I hope it will not be long before he does."	"austen"
"Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts."	"austen"
"She could never quit him."	"austen"
"You said you had a great many, and now you have not one left."	"austen"
"He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap."	"austen"
"He had never been in the room at the Crown in his lifedid not know the people who kept it by sight.Oh!"	"austen"
"Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."	"austen"
"So very good of them to send her the whole way!"	"austen"
"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!We shall be always meeting!"	"austen"
"She is a riddle, quite a riddle!"	"austen"
"I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man."	"austen"
"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this, thought Emma; to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of love on each side."	"austen"
"You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!Oh!"	"austen"
"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the Eltons, was his next observation.His feelings are natural.What!"	"austen"
"She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding."	"austen"
"Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting."	"austen"
"It must, if I were not here."	"austen"
"Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other!"	"austen"
"I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove."	"austen"
"She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely without inclination for the party."	"austen"
"Why should he marry?He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of his brother's children."	"austen"
"Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all!"	"austen"
"How?They were invited, were not they?"	"austen"
"Two such could never be granted."	"austen"
"Mrs. Elton was spoken of."	"austen"
"you are not serious now."	"austen"
"Emma turned round to look at her in consternation, and hastily said, Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?"	"austen"
"She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match."	"austen"
"Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect."	"austen"
"I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere."	"austen"
"Such an eye!the true hazle eyeand so brilliant!"	"austen"
"This will not be your only visit to Randalls."	"austen"
"She asked after their mutual friends; they were all well.When had he left them?Only that morning."	"austen"
"He must have had a wet ride.Yes.He meant to walk with her, she found."	"austen"
"Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done."	"austen"
"You are not just to Harriet's claims."	"austen"
"Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very desirable."	"austen"
"Were she your equal in situationbut, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case."	"austen"
"I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see."	"austen"
"But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it."	"austen"
"In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are."	"austen"
"They will come and stand by my chair, and say, 'Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?'"	"austen"
"poor fellow!sad business for him.She was extremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.How could he be so taken in?Did not think him at all in lovenot in the least.Poor Knightley!There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him!"	"austen"
"you amuse me excessively."	"austen"
"What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has before him!Assured of the love of such a womanthe disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,equality of situationI mean, as far as regards society, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but oneand that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of her regard, must, I think, be the happiest of mortals.Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune."	"austen"
"She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help."	"austen"
"I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it."	"austen"
"Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs. Weston's accounting for it with I suppose they will not take the liberty with you; they know you do not dine out, was not quite sufficient."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began againMr."	"austen"
"Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life."	"austen"
"Now he has got my letter, said she softly."	"austen"
"Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind!"	"austen"
"I never saw such a likeness in my life."	"austen"
"A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut."	"austen"
"But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future."	"austen"
"As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.Yes, believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme."	"austen"
"Bought at Weymouth, you knowMr."	"austen"
"No; he was talking to Mrs. Colehe was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else, and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole."	"austen"
"The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, Hum!"	"austen"
"But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's only objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction."	"austen"
"The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual observations made."	"austen"
"in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined."	"austen"
"As to myself, I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelingsNothing could be farther from my wishesyour attachment to my friend Harrietyour pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent."	"austen"
"It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude."	"austen"
"Not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a partner."	"austen"
"Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away."	"austen"
"I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer."	"austen"
"The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion."	"austen"
"Her own behaviour had been so very improper!"	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it."	"austen"
"I should be sorry to be more."	"austen"
"It was too old a story.Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet.They took a few turns together along the walk.The shade was most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day."	"austen"
"He did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get the speech of him."	"austen"
"She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period."	"austen"
"He came to the part of the room where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of maintaining it."	"austen"
"But Mr. Weston is almost an old man."	"austen"
"She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhoodand sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half."	"austen"
"how peculiarly unprepared I was!for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him, much more, than she was before."	"austen"
"Latterly, howeverfor some time, indeedI have had no idea of their meaning any thing.I thought them a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side."	"austen"
"The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before."	"austen"
"She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have Harriet's picture."	"austen"
"Four o'clock!depend upon it he will be here by three, was Mr. Weston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting."	"austen"
"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance."	"austen"
"I give you credit for it."	"austen"
"His manner had no air of study or exaggeration."	"austen"
"for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits, and Mr. Elton's time is so engaged."	"austen"
"He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon afterwards said, in a lively tone, Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me."	"austen"
"Harriet's sweet easy temper will not mind it."	"austen"
"But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January."	"austen"
"I am most happy to hear itbut only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!and exactly Emma's age."	"austen"
"It will do you good to speak of your distress, whatever it may be."	"austen"
"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others, rejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part."	"austen"
"It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton."	"austen"
"CHAPTER VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet's side, as there could be any occasion for."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously."	"austen"
"What has he been judging by?I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.But it was so, I suppose."	"austen"
"I am sure Miss Nash wouldfor Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a linen-draper."	"austen"
"Ah!so you say; but I cannot believe it."	"austen"
"Excepting inequality of fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable."	"austen"
"She was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that her intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on Isabella's letters."	"austen"
"Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him justice."	"austen"
"YesI have called there; passing the door, I thought it better."	"austen"
"I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony."	"austen"
"I know what your drawings are."	"austen"
"There is one subject, he replied, I hope but one, on which we do not think alike."	"austen"
"I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person."	"austen"
"She was vexed beyond what could have been expressedalmost beyond what she could conceal."	"austen"
"It confesses that you have long understood me."	"austen"
"How do you like it?Selina's choicehandsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over-trimmedquite a horror of finery."	"austen"
"She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense."	"austen"
"This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating."	"austen"
"A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection."	"austen"
"A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter."	"austen"
"A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again."	"austen"
"Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!"	"austen"
"You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence."	"austen"
"My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining-room."	"austen"
"And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!"	"austen"
"Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her better; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now.Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the otherwhat was she?Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matterwhich was most probablestill, in knowing her as she ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's."	"austen"
"She opened the packet; it was too surely so;a note from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"She recalled her past kindnessthe kindness, the affection of sixteen yearshow she had taught and how she had played with her from five years oldhow she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in healthand how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood."	"austen"
"He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends."	"austen"
"One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland."	"austen"
"A conundrum of Mr. Weston's shall clear him and his next neighbour."	"austen"
"She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming, characteristic situation, low and shelteredits ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sightand its abundance of timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.It was just what it ought to be, and it looked what it wasand Emma felt an increasing respect for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted in blood and understanding.Some faults of temper John Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably."	"austen"
"Emma was most sincerely interested."	"austen"
"The word was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away."	"austen"
"Mrs. Westonit is too calm a censure."	"austen"
"Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue."	"austen"
"If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry."	"austen"
"It was a sweet viewsweet to the eye and the mind."	"austen"
"They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment."	"austen"
"'Not that it was such a very old petticoat eitherfor still it would last a great whileand, indeed, she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.'"	"austen"
"I never shall forget his manner."	"austen"
"But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see."	"austen"
"She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness."	"austen"
"what a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!"	"austen"
"He has had great faults, faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am very ready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants."	"austen"
"She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her."	"austen"
"She had many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day."	"austen"
"She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy."	"austen"
"You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night."	"austen"
"He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late."	"austen"
"cried Emma, this has been a most unfortunatemost deplorable mistake!What is to be done?"	"austen"
"united, what reverse we have!"	"austen"
"You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she is destined to be?"	"austen"
"Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife."	"austen"
"Emma could not speak."	"austen"
"The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther, Ah!"	"austen"
"While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of saying, And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain."	"austen"
"Elton's absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired."	"austen"
"I will say that for you."	"austen"
"All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach?"	"austen"
"Now they seemed in pleasant conversation."	"austen"
"Read it, read it, said he, it will give you pleasure; only a few lineswill not take you long; read it to Emma."	"austen"
"Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away; and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had left the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow, came back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour hence."	"austen"
"She was, in fact, beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind, she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again."	"austen"
"His gallantry was always on the alert."	"austen"
"And how beautiful we thought he looked!"	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last night; how extremely pleasant.Did you ever see such dancing?Was not it delightful?Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any thing equal to it."	"austen"
"Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave."	"austen"
"It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure, previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but one."	"austen"
"She had suffered very much from cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerlessand in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain."	"austen"
"Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first."	"austen"
"Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I meanI do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addressesand as Jane used to be very often walking out with themfor Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had taken himself."	"austen"
"Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper."	"austen"
"While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either."	"austen"
"I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize."	"austen"
"Will you chuse a wife for me?I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you."	"austen"
"continued Mrs. Elton; Knightley himself!Was not it lucky?for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.'s, I had a great curiosity."	"austen"
"There has been a solemn engagement between them ever since Octoberformed at Weymouth, and kept a secret from every body."	"austen"
"When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animationor of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say, I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs. Weston's letters."	"austen"
"Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly careful, especially at this time of year."	"austen"
"Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening."	"austen"
"Her attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on such occasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his particular compliments to the ladies, was ending with herand with all his mildest urbanity, said, I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning in the rain."	"austen"
"She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass."	"austen"
"I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week."	"austen"
"Now, ma'am, said Jane to her aunt, shall we join Mrs. Elton?"	"austen"
"Were you really?Well!But you observed nothing of course, for it seems to be a new idea to you.If I had been there, I think I should have made some discoveries."	"austen"
"It is fit that the fortune should be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers."	"austen"
"Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl."	"austen"
"What is to be done, my dear Emma?what is to be done?"	"austen"
"While he staid, the Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned, judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin's visit."	"austen"
"Such might be his constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking some refreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining-roomand she humanely pointed out the door."	"austen"
"Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield."	"austen"
"Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogetherface and figure?"	"austen"
"The truth of this representation there was no denying."	"austen"
"William Larkins mentioned it here."	"austen"
"and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to methis pianoforte that has been sent here by somebodythough we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley?"	"austen"
"Do you know it?Cramer.And here are a new set of Irish melodies."	"austen"
"You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married."	"austen"
"exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, No, he is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation."	"austen"
"Her height was pretty, just such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two."	"austen"
"Mr. Dixon's preference of her music to her friend's, I can answer for being very decided."	"austen"
"What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy?"	"austen"
"He will connect himself well if he can."	"austen"
"Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.No judge of his own manners by you.Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.Fancying you to have fathomed his secret."	"austen"
"She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself."	"austen"
"She is very fond of Frank, and therefore I would not speak ill of her."	"austen"
"I saw her answer!nothing could be clearer."	"austen"
"Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared whenever they met again,self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred."	"austen"
"Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in."	"austen"
"She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he could even wish."	"austen"
"Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour."	"austen"
"The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background."	"austen"
"They talked at first only of the performance."	"austen"
"You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars."	"austen"
"Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on one subject."	"austen"
"Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak."	"austen"
"You wrote me word of it three months ago."	"austen"
"Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork!"	"austen"
"He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us.They are coming in, I hope."	"austen"
"Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.Could he have seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return."	"austen"
"It was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving painno remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist."	"austen"
"The style of the visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive."	"austen"
"Quite delightful to have you all meet so!Our little room so honoured!"	"austen"
"They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave."	"austen"
"You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?"	"austen"
"Oh yes!that is, noI do not knowbut I believe he has read a good dealbut not what you would think any thing of."	"austen"
"Every door was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten."	"austen"
"The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be saidmuch praise and many commentsundoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerably;but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin."	"austen"
"Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father's hints, his mother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story."	"austen"
"He was looking about, he was going to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her."	"austen"
"He was soon pretty well resigned."	"austen"
"The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was modern and well-built."	"austen"
"He must think himself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing."	"austen"
"Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's, turned to Frank Churchill."	"austen"
"Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing thoughts."	"austen"
"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before us."	"austen"
"Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.You know you could not."	"austen"
"More than an attachment, indeed, resumed Mrs. Weston; an engagementa positive engagement.What will you say, Emmawhat will any body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged;nay, that they have been long engaged!"	"austen"
"The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought, she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more."	"austen"
"One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprizea second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill."	"austen"
"She had no doubt as to his being less in lovebut neither his agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long."	"austen"
"William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year."	"austen"
"Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there."	"austen"
"Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the young friend she wantedexactly the something which her home required."	"austen"
"William Larkins is such an old acquaintance!"	"austen"
"Mr. Elton is going to be married."	"austen"
"She is playing Robin Adair at this momenthis favourite."	"austen"
"MY DEAR MADAM, If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected; but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and indulgence.You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent."	"austen"
"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business?"	"austen"
"their luxury and ease."	"austen"
"Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax."	"austen"
"It was growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her mother's account."	"austen"
"But why should you be sorry, sir?I assure you, it did the children a great deal of good."	"austen"
"He could not be satisfied without a promisewould not she give him her influence in procuring it?"	"austen"
"Manners were all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill."	"austen"
"Well, there is feeling here.He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill.Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of her."	"austen"
"You have hit upon the very thing to please me."	"austen"
"Impossible!I never can call you any thing but 'Mr."	"austen"
"As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued; but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and subduedand in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some alloy."	"austen"
"I had only my own family to study from."	"austen"
"So afraid you might have a headache!seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have."	"austen"
"I thought you meant to go with me."	"austen"
"She could not compose herself Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmedshe had better go;with most ready encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through another doorand the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of Emma's feelings: Oh God!"	"austen"
"Towards the end of Jane's second song, her voice grew thick."	"austen"
"I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon."	"austen"
"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates!"	"austen"
"It comes to the same thing."	"austen"
"You did not enjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time."	"austen"
"Did you ever hear any thing so strange?"	"austen"
"As a daughter, she hoped she was not without a heart."	"austen"
"At last, and tolerably in his usual tone, he said, I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.I can suppose, however, that I may have underrated him."	"austen"
"There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow."	"austen"
"But you will do every thing right."	"austen"
"He seems every thing the fondest parent could...."	"austen"
"She would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked."	"austen"
"One can suppose nothing else, added Mrs. Cole, and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt."	"austen"
"I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for myself, shall be most happyIt seems the only improvement that could be."	"austen"
"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have."	"austen"
"That she was not immediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; and Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again."	"austen"
"that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin."	"austen"
"Dinner-parties and evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day."	"austen"
"By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her's, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;but Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being very cold, certainly very cold, and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening."	"austen"
"After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than Harriet's returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance."	"austen"
"She must see more of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they were agreeable."	"austen"
"Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he looked back, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago."	"austen"
"Donwell Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry."	"austen"
"Something of a very unpleasant nature, I find, has occurred;do let me know directly what it is."	"austen"
"Voices approached the shopor rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door."	"austen"
"Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write; and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the time proposed."	"austen"
"Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was extremely happy about it."	"austen"
"How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself, and living under!The blunders, the blindness of her own head and heart!she sat still, she walked about, she tried her own room, she tried the shrubberyin every place, every posture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness."	"austen"
"can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?Absurd and insufferable!Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners."	"austen"
"The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity."	"austen"
"Respect for right conduct is felt by every body."	"austen"
"I see the difference plain enough."	"austen"
"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"Nobody else would come so early.'"	"austen"
"But what are you in doubt of?"	"austen"
"All looked up to them."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other."	"austen"
"Cole had just been there, just called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them, and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too."	"austen"
"Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her."	"austen"
"It is natural, and it is honourable.Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.But that it will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise."	"austen"
"He had been going to call on them."	"austen"
"It was a palpable display, repeated on every possible occasion."	"austen"
"I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love."	"austen"
"She came solitarily down the gravel walka Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility."	"austen"
"Jane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma."	"austen"
"The remaining five were left to their own powers, and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent."	"austen"
"They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were superseded."	"austen"
"it shews what a sad invalid I am!"	"austen"
"Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited."	"austen"
"I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held."	"austen"
"my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing."	"austen"
"If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you hesitate?"	"austen"
"She would not look again."	"austen"
"I have a very strong notion that it comes from him."	"austen"
"She deserves a better fate."	"austen"
"He came with Mrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially."	"austen"
"I never was more surprizedbut it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.Howhow has it been possible?"	"austen"
"My father would say 'yes,' Mr. Knightley 'no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium."	"austen"
"I am sure she will be pleased with the children."	"austen"
"You were mentioning May."	"austen"
"His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter."	"austen"
"I knew who it came from."	"austen"
"I have no idea of that sort of thing."	"austen"
"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!"	"austen"
"There, not to be vulgar, was distinction, and merit."	"austen"
"She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home."	"austen"
"It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room."	"austen"
"Emma looked graciously."	"austen"
"Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?"	"austen"
"Thy ready wit the word will soon supply."	"austen"
"Things did not seemthat is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.So it appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken."	"austen"
"With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained."	"austen"
"'And to this day, I do believe, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter's."	"austen"
"You will not like the noise."	"austen"
"and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, These are my own concerns."	"austen"
"Imprudent, if you pleasebut not mad."	"austen"
"At first, while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world."	"austen"
"It would only be giving trouble and distress."	"austen"
"She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more."	"austen"
"He said nothing worth hearinglooked without seeingadmired without intelligencelistened without knowing what she said."	"austen"
"I dare say she did not understand me."	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome, the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most serviceable lightfirst, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good onewell aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.It was agreed upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or otherin another year or two, perhapsit might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper."	"austen"
"But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her very differently affected."	"austen"
"He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through."	"austen"
"It was, indeed, a highly prized letter."	"austen"
"It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite."	"austen"
"I could do very well without it."	"austen"
"This present from the Campbells, said shethis pianoforte is very kindly given."	"austen"
"And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother's old petticoat."	"austen"
"The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time."	"austen"
"But, Mr. Knightley, how could you possibly have heard it?"	"austen"
"You are right, Mrs. Weston, said Mr. Knightley warmly, Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton."	"austen"
"You, sir, may say any thing, cried Mr. Elton, but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit!"	"austen"
"From Harriet's happening not to be at Hartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good."	"austen"
"Her caution was thrown away."	"austen"
"Weston, who had been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview."	"austen"
"But every thing of that kind, said Emma, will soon be in so regular a train Well, said Mrs. Elton, laughing, we shall see."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston had, of course, formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured."	"austen"
"Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something, though she knew not what."	"austen"
"Except the Sucklings and Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance."	"austen"
"yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins's week's account; much rather, I confess.Pleasure in seeing dancing!not I, indeedI never look at itI do not know who does.Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward."	"austen"
"He could sing a little himself."	"austen"
"I was very often influenced rightly by youoftener than I would own at the time."	"austen"
"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me, said Emma, and a very considerable onethat I made the match myself."	"austen"
"I wish I were anywhere else."	"austen"
"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining."	"austen"
"The spring I always think requires more than common care."	"austen"
"I shall soon have done."	"austen"
"You like Mr. Elton, papa,I must look about for a wife for him."	"austen"
"To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the high opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge, she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another."	"austen"
"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite a mistake, sir.We all had our health perfectly well there, never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly."	"austen"
"The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart."	"austen"
"yes, quite indispensable."	"austen"
"It is his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight."	"austen"
"You may believe me, Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"she cried, looking aghast."	"austen"
"Such a debasement on his!"	"austen"
"No sacrifice on any side worth the name."	"austen"
"The thing is determined, that is (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master."	"austen"
"But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing!"	"austen"
"Not for the world, said Emma, smiling graciously, would I advise you either way."	"austen"
"No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself."	"austen"
"I can understand you(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed."	"austen"
"He knows the value of a good income as well as any body."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and all the dessert."	"austen"
"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before."	"austen"
"CHAPTER IV Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of."	"austen"
"But there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch."	"austen"
"I told you he was plain."	"austen"
"Do not let me lose it."	"austen"
"Churchill's state, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependenceand Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming.Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion."	"austen"
"I am a great advocate for timidityand I am sure one does not often meet with it.But in those who are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing."	"austen"
"A walk before breakfast does me good."	"austen"
"Had she left her where she ought, and where he had told her she ought!Had she not, with a folly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belongall would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been."	"austen"
"I thought I should have fainted."	"austen"
"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having any idea of his name."	"austen"
"She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of."	"austen"
"said he directly, 'there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.'"	"austen"
"She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked."	"austen"
"It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious, which she did not wish."	"austen"
"It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely from them, Ah!"	"austen"
"I shall be very glad to look it over, said he; but it seems long."	"austen"
"She loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing."	"austen"
"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse."	"austen"
"Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn."	"austen"
"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?Going to the post-office in the rain!This must not be, I assure you.You sad girl, how could you do such a thing?It is a sign I was not there to take care of you."	"austen"
"He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and he was not without agitation."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect, replied Emma; but where there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great deal."	"austen"
"This charade!If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have made any thing like it."	"austen"
"It is like a woman's writing."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, I did not know that he ever had any such plan."	"austen"
"Her manners, tooand Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet."	"austen"
"If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what can be done."	"austen"
"While he lived, it must be only an engagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.How to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;how to spare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement; how to appear least her enemy?On these subjects, her perplexity and distress were very greatand her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.She could only resolve at last, that she would still avoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury, andindulging in one scheme morenearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square.Isabella had been pleased with Harriet; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.She did not think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the evil day, when they must all be together again."	"austen"
"For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself."	"austen"
"I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet."	"austen"
"I am quite determined to refuse him."	"austen"
"You know, Mrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves."	"austen"
"No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please."	"austen"
"He will be so pleased to see my little ones."	"austen"
"But I ought to have gone before."	"austen"
"You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do."	"austen"
"An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill!"	"austen"
"She was proved to have been universally mistaken; and she had not quite done nothingfor she had done mischief."	"austen"
"I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else."	"austen"
"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been to South End."	"austen"
"Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed into again."	"austen"
"It is one that I shall never change, however."	"austen"
"It seems like madness!"	"austen"
"You will say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my compliments, of course."	"austen"
"To know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!She does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves."	"austen"
"Mrs. Elton's resources were inadequate to such an attack."	"austen"
"We never see any thing of it on our club-nights."	"austen"
"She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved."	"austen"
"She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend."	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas."	"austen"
"So much superadded decision of character!"	"austen"
"The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;and they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come."	"austen"
"Some people were always cross when they were hot."	"austen"
"It can be round in five minutes."	"austen"
"I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many others."	"austen"
"They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome."	"austen"
"I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as you made no objection, I never did it again."	"austen"
"Much better employed talking to the young ladies."	"austen"
"Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before himbut there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour."	"austen"
"I have heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax!"	"austen"
"I thought him very plain at first, but I do not think him so plain now."	"austen"
"He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, I will give it to hershall I?and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth."	"austen"
"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return?"	"austen"
"It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!"	"austen"
"They might chuse to surprize her."	"austen"
"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad, said he."	"austen"
"And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her."	"austen"
"It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour, by all her principles, admire it:elegance, which, whether of person or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury."	"austen"
"This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved his life."	"austen"
"You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?"	"austen"
"In the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the very next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse."	"austen"
"CHAPTER VIII The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all the evening."	"austen"
"He has passed you very often."	"austen"
"And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!"	"austen"
"I must love him; and now that I am satisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may."	"austen"
"I have an idea he was standing just here."	"austen"
"True affection only could have prompted it."	"austen"
"Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr. Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls."	"austen"
"I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that."	"austen"
"The impossibility of her quitting her father, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility of any other change, he could not agree to."	"austen"
"Very true, very true, indeed."	"austen"
"This was all sent with the instrument."	"austen"
"She was ready to tell every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain."	"austen"
"There was too much domestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in it; Isabella was too much like Emmadiffering only in those striking inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him, for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.He had stayed on, however, vigorously, day after daytill this very morning's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.Then, with the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel, having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that he could stay no longer."	"austen"
"But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry."	"austen"
"The lovers were standing together at one of the windows."	"austen"
"So extremely like Maple Grove!"	"austen"
"While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her."	"austen"
"During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension, now spread over his air."	"austen"
"So unlike what a man should be!None of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man should display in every transaction of his life."	"austen"
"He was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could staybut that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said."	"austen"
"There was no occasion to press the matter farther."	"austen"
"So I remember to have heard."	"austen"
"While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton made his appearance."	"austen"
"It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers."	"austen"
"You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as you were the person slighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's compassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you."	"austen"
"When I look back to the first time I saw him!"	"austen"
"Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in her present state, would be dangerous."	"austen"
"It is one thing, said she, presentlyher cheeks in a glowto have very good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you must, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like this."	"austen"
"He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremelythought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him harshly."	"austen"
"He was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted."	"austen"
"Her intentions were unchanged."	"austen"
"The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill."	"austen"
"This is great news, indeed."	"austen"
"said he, offering his hand."	"austen"
"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think the sooner you go the better."	"austen"
"Yes, said Emma, I hope I do."	"austen"
"my dear,' said Iwell, and just then came the note."	"austen"
"Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments."	"austen"
"if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther, We do not say a word of any assistance that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.Oh!"	"austen"
"What strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that she must be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous determination against it."	"austen"
"It was a pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically, when he once said, Emma, you have been no friend to Harriet Smith.She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed."	"austen"
"The preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertaintyat the riskin her opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain."	"austen"
"It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found; for it shall be attended to."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him."	"austen"
"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me."	"austen"
"There will not be time for any thing."	"austen"
"There is nothing to be compared to it."	"austen"
"No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out."	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed."	"austen"
"We explored to King's-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the barouche-landau."	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in."	"austen"
"You will have no business here.Let it stay, however,' said she; 'give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back."	"austen"
"Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's."	"austen"
"You can have no superior, but most true on mine.She is a complete angel."	"austen"
"Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing."	"austen"
"now you are looking very sly."	"austen"
"She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her, occurred again and again, she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept."	"austen"
"I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you."	"austen"
"In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of object, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane, Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!what a dear creature he is;I assure you I like him excessively."	"austen"
"Do you think him so very plain?"	"austen"
"Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing."	"austen"
"Harriet bore the intelligence very wellblaming nobodyand in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend."	"austen"
"He would either have gloried in the achievement, or been ashamed of it."	"austen"
"Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future."	"austen"
"She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill."	"austen"
"My mother's are really very good indeed."	"austen"
"and that's so dreadful!"	"austen"
"I do not know, my dear."	"austen"
"Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her."	"austen"
"I am sure of having their opinions with me."	"austen"
"She talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affectionbut she had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended with, We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come, she was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for."	"austen"
"There probably was something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds."	"austen"
"It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly feel the omission."	"austen"
"No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you for reminding me."	"austen"
"The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed, so deservedly dear."	"austen"
"I could not bear it for Emma!Emma is not strong."	"austen"
"Well, time does fly indeed!and my memory is very bad."	"austen"
"But the imprudence of such a match!"	"austen"
"She gained on them, however, involuntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them."	"austen"
"he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while."	"austen"
"Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally; so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them, and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive."	"austen"
"She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing."	"austen"
"As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again."	"austen"
"Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls."	"austen"
"You ought to know your friend best, replied Mr. Knightley; but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her."	"austen"
"His spirits required support."	"austen"
"Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback."	"austen"
"She was delighted with the fortitude of her little friendfor fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax."	"austen"
"You were kept waiting at the doorI was quite ashamedbut somehow there was a little bustlefor it so happened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not know any body was coming."	"austen"
"I know what you meanbut Emma's hand is the strongest."	"austen"
"Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman."	"austen"
"at present I ask no more."	"austen"
"True, true, you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl she is."	"austen"
"Dixon is very musical, is he?"	"austen"
"The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration."	"austen"
"To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our objectif one could but tell what that would be."	"austen"
"I wanted to know a little more, and this tells me quite enough."	"austen"
"Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one."	"austen"
"He rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced, and how she must act."	"austen"
"I think your manners to him encouraging."	"austen"
"I have often talked to her a good deal."	"austen"
"Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself."	"austen"
"What blindness, what madness, had led her on!"	"austen"
"How do you like Mrs. Elton?"	"austen"
"Come, my dear Emma, let us be friends, and say no more about it."	"austen"
"She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause."	"austen"
"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out."	"austen"
"He has been wanting to come to us, continued Mr. Weston, ever since September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his own time."	"austen"
"And Mrs. Weston!Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman!"	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley shook his head at her."	"austen"
"I dare not let my mother know how little she eatsso I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off."	"austen"
"There was no bearing such an always; and to break through her dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of Wheremay I ask?is Miss Fairfax going?"	"austen"
"Emma saw him only once; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure just to meet with him, or just to miss him, just to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, just to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture."	"austen"
"I honour his sincerity."	"austen"
"my sins, my sins!And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!One of my senseless tricks!I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.Well(sitting down again)go onwhat else?"	"austen"
"And you must be off this very morning?"	"austen"
"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed, said Mr. Woodhouse, with a sigh."	"austen"
"Her present home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:confined always to one room;he could have wished it otherwiseand her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description."	"austen"
"How did you all behave?"	"austen"
"A cold stormy rain set in, and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights the longer visible."	"austen"
"She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her for ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such alliance for him, as most unequal and degrading."	"austen"
"They must encounter each other, and make the best of it."	"austen"
"Compare Mr. Martin with either of them."	"austen"
"Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strongand her temper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control; but it wants openness."	"austen"
"He knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away."	"austen"
"And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose youjust as I begin to know you."	"austen"
"And, indeed, though my mother's eyes are not so good as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God!"	"austen"
"This is just what Perry said."	"austen"
"You should have consulted Perry."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about."	"austen"
"She disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.She was displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even cold."	"austen"
"Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly."	"austen"
"I hope he does, replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter."	"austen"
"Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!Oh!"	"austen"
"It is my daily errand."	"austen"
"Depend upon it he had encouragement."	"austen"
"Much, much beyond impropriety!It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion."	"austen"
"This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer."	"austen"
"He will be a completely gross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of nothing but profit and loss."	"austen"
"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?"	"austen"
"Shall I ring the bell?"	"austen"
"He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed."	"austen"
"He is very young to settle, was Mr. Woodhouse's observation."	"austen"
"With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not told."	"austen"
"How I catch myself out!"	"austen"
"Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them much better."	"austen"
"I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me."	"austen"
"I should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come."	"austen"
"No, it by no means wanted strengthit was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong."	"austen"
"He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a smile, observed, Humph!"	"austen"
"There is no comparison between them."	"austen"
"I come in for a pretty good share as a second."	"austen"
"very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes."	"austen"
"They can do nothing satisfactorily without you."	"austen"
"I should be quite in the way."	"austen"
"Your word!why not your honour!why not say upon your honour, that it has nothing to do with any of them?"	"austen"
"CHAPTER XIV Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;Mr. Elton must compose his joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour."	"austen"
"That, from such a quarter, one might expect."	"austen"
"There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted."	"austen"
"With all dear Emma's little faults, she is an excellent creature."	"austen"
"This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation."	"austen"
"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate knowledge of their situation."	"austen"
"CHAPTER XVII When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself."	"austen"
"You have given Miss Smith all that she required, said he; you have made her graceful and easy."	"austen"
"Emma, my dear Emma Oh!"	"austen"
"It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned."	"austen"
"Lively as he was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury."	"austen"
"She absolutely refused to allow me, which I then thought most unreasonable."	"austen"
"She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me, she continuedlike La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis, in Madame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan."	"austen"
"Considering how very handsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way."	"austen"
"dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!excellent time."	"austen"
"My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense."	"austen"
"The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon."	"austen"
"I dare say, replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, that I thought so then;but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting to do any thing I wished."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing."	"austen"
"A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows."	"austen"
"Well, I am so sorry!Oh!"	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him."	"austen"
"What would you advise me to do?"	"austen"
"I met William Larkins, continued Mr. Elton, as I got near the house, and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not believe him.William seemed rather out of humour."	"austen"
"My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us."	"austen"
"Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circlebut that is not the change I had in view for you."	"austen"
"If one thinks of all that it has to do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!"	"austen"
"When they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very delightfully!He seemed to want to be acquainted with her."	"austen"
"Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does."	"austen"
"They will stay a good while when they do come, and he will be half his time with us."	"austen"
"I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.I think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long preface.We are quite well.This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never own being affected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east wind.I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing last night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill. Yours ever, A. W. WINDSOR-JULY."	"austen"
"On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days."	"austen"
"She, therefore, said no more for some time."	"austen"
"One could not leave her out."	"austen"
"Well done, Mrs. Martin!"	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston's manners, said Emma, were always particularly good."	"austen"
"And it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed."	"austen"
"It was the very circumstance he could have wished for."	"austen"
"That will be a much better thing."	"austen"
"Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn."	"austen"
"'So very kind and obliging!But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!'"	"austen"
"I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper nameI should rather say Barnes, or Bates."	"austen"
"she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure."	"austen"
"Well, said he, in a deliberating manner, for five minutes, perhaps."	"austen"
"She introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other."	"austen"
"Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet."	"austen"
"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?"	"austen"
"He was not hungry; it would only make him hotter."	"austen"
"She had been thinking of him the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind."	"austen"
"CHAPTER V I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston, said Mr. Knightley, of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing."	"austen"
"The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family, the lawyer of Highbury."	"austen"
"You could not have visited me!"	"austen"
"He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair, was provoking him exceedingly."	"austen"
"Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton's way beforeand no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if not in consciousness."	"austen"
"Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off."	"austen"
"If any thing, you are too attentive."	"austen"
"My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days."	"austen"
"cried his wife.My dear Mr. E., you have not been to Donwell!You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown."	"austen"
"As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she is quite in the dark."	"austen"
"so sillyso satisfiedso smilingso prosingso undistinguishing and unfastidiousand so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry to-morrow."	"austen"
"I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown."	"austen"
"I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case."	"austen"
"Me!I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being so rich and so liberal.It is a handsome present."	"austen"
"Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, I will not pretend not to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are apprehensive of."	"austen"
"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her!"	"austen"
"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would."	"austen"
"He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again."	"austen"
"CHAPTER XVIII I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you, said Mr. Weston."	"austen"
"The whole party walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though May, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant."	"austen"
"In the present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away, These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good."	"austen"
"He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite themvery kind and sensiblemuch cleverer than dining out.He was not fond of dining out."	"austen"
"The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr. Weston made his appearance among them."	"austen"
"Nothing, but to grow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own."	"austen"
"And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded."	"austen"
"And yet, said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon stoppingit was better, however, to know the worst at onceshe hurried onAnd yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is."	"austen"
"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this morning."	"austen"
"He had no idea of me."	"austen"
"In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax."	"austen"
"Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost; and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on Harriet's side, not her own."	"austen"
"Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both."	"austen"
"Another view of man, my second brings, Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!"	"austen"
"As a magistrate, he had generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next year, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life, and whose attachments were strong."	"austen"
"This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself."	"austen"
"Somebody said that Miss Gilbert was expected at her brother's, and must be invited with the rest."	"austen"
"It was very natural for you to say, what right has he to lecture me?and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner."	"austen"
"My mother often talks of your good-nature."	"austen"
"You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances."	"austen"
"His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and the walk he had had for nothing."	"austen"
"I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual."	"austen"
"I would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your raising your thoughts to him, is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value."	"austen"
"The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her."	"austen"
"I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse."	"austen"
"at three-and-twenty to be the king of his companythe great manthe practised politician, who is to read every body's character, and make every body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to be dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself!"	"austen"
"'Which you know shewed him to be so very...."	"austen"
"Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less allied with real love."	"austen"
"The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas."	"austen"
"And it cannot be for the value of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know?"	"austen"
"Wellbut if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely clever."	"austen"
"In one moment such a change!"	"austen"
"Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say."	"austen"
"If it can be contrived to be at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses."	"austen"
"It reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs. Weston's wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy."	"austen"
"replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint."	"austen"
"She spoke as she felt, with earnest regret and solicitudesincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage and comfort as possible."	"austen"
"She inherits her mother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her."	"austen"
"This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when."	"austen"
"True, true, he answered, warmly."	"austen"
"Any nonsense will serve."	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added, Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty kind of young person."	"austen"
"CHAPTER VII Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to have his hair cut."	"austen"
"Emma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased enough to exclaim, You are not vain, Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:but yet, I thinkhad you not been in the caseI should still have distrusted him."	"austen"
"Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind her.He was thoughtful."	"austen"
"She did not regret it."	"austen"
"So sudden!You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in!"	"austen"
"Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to."	"austen"
"It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had she deemed it possible enough for wishing."	"austen"
"But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any body, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her."	"austen"
"It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage."	"austen"
"(as soon as she was within the door) Well!"	"austen"
"Often as she had wished for and ordered it, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable."	"austen"
"True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax."	"austen"
"And when, thought Emma, will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?"	"austen"
"And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it."	"austen"
"Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before himI believe, at leastI am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before his death."	"austen"
"Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.Mrs."	"austen"
"They were looking over views in Swisserland."	"austen"
"Thank you, my mother is remarkably well."	"austen"
"It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her kindnessand with Emma it was grown into a first wish."	"austen"
"Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing."	"austen"
"It is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane."	"austen"
"They were a family of the name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwellvery creditably, she believedshe knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of thembut they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect."	"austen"
"Miss Smith!oh!I had not observed.You are extremely obligingand if I were not an old married man.But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago."	"austen"
"It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again."	"austen"
"Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she had less scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with respect to her.This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings."	"austen"
"He will have every body's wishes for his happiness."	"austen"
"But soon it came to be on one side, But will there be good room for five couple?I really do not think there will."	"austen"
"That may be done without horses."	"austen"
"Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admirationbut without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's knight-errantry on the subject."	"austen"
"Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said, You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit, then He was silent."	"austen"
"I admired your resolution very much, sir, said he, in venturing out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon."	"austen"
"That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my present perfect indifference, she continued, I will farther tell you, that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I did like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to himnay, was attachedand how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder."	"austen"
"And now, let me talk to you of something else."	"austen"
"It is infinitely too bad."	"austen"
"I have read worse charades."	"austen"
"I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner."	"austen"
"I am delighted to find myself in such a circle."	"austen"
"My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good."	"austen"
"You might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?"	"austen"
"Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive."	"austen"
"And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of her conversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real, generous affection."	"austen"
"Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr. Wingfield's, which we have been applying at times ever since August."	"austen"
"Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would be ingratitude."	"austen"
"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure."	"austen"
"For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole's noteno, it cannot be more than fiveor at least tenfor I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come outI was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the porkJane was standing in the passagewere not you, Jane?for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough."	"austen"
"You understand every thing."	"austen"
"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells."	"austen"
"No, no, said she, you are quite unreasonable."	"austen"
"She looked on with some amusement.Miss Bates's gratitude for Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth."	"austen"
"Are you talking about me?I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does not deserve."	"austen"
"But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment."	"austen"
"They are very importantand sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them."	"austen"
"Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give."	"austen"
"My friend Robert could not resist."	"austen"
"They are blended, said he, I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous, I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good."	"austen"
"Supper was announced."	"austen"
"The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking for us."	"austen"
"May its approval beam in that soft eye!"	"austen"
"The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.He saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it."	"austen"
"She was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again."	"austen"
"And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is!"	"austen"
"I have heard her speak of the acquaintance, said Emma; she is a very elegant young woman."	"austen"
"It was a long, well-written letter, giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision."	"austen"
"On another, And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up."	"austen"
"She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme."	"austen"
"He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment."	"austen"
"You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into."	"austen"
"She could not endure to give him the true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them."	"austen"
"And Jane will have such another."	"austen"
"How do you do?Very well, I thank you."	"austen"
"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child."	"austen"
"Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much.It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been given also."	"austen"
"She believed every body spoke well of him."	"austen"
"I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way."	"austen"
"say beautiful rather."	"austen"
"I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him."	"austen"
"He had been at the pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject."	"austen"
"Do you think it is a good one?"	"austen"
"This happened the night before last."	"austen"
"But it would not do; he had not come to the point."	"austen"
"He would do any good to her, or her family; but Well, said Mrs. Weston, laughing, perhaps the greatest good he could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home."	"austen"
"It is not Swisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change."	"austen"
"Read it in comfort to yourself."	"austen"
"I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us all in.Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation."	"austen"
"And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little intention of ever marrying at all."	"austen"
"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home."	"austen"
"His tall, firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, excepting her own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.He moved a few steps nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he but take the trouble.Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but in general he was looking grave."	"austen"
"She would keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brother's disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was important.It had a high claim to forbearance."	"austen"
"You will all be going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up."	"austen"
"She is a woman that one may, that one must laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight."	"austen"
"Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way."	"austen"
"He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the samebut yet he must confess, that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health."	"austen"
"It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles."	"austen"
"CHAPTER VII They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in favour of a pleasant party."	"austen"
"continued Harrietthese two last!But how shall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?Oh!"	"austen"
"She could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question."	"austen"
"Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour."	"austen"
"said Emma, highly amused.Mr."	"austen"
"Well, I shall bring Jane with meJane and her aunt.The rest I leave to you."	"austen"
"This is the simple truth."	"austen"
"Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton."	"austen"
"Frank's was the first idea; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance."	"austen"
"Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word."	"austen"
"A little while ago, he was at Weymouth."	"austen"
"She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes."	"austen"
"She has not the least idea."	"austen"
"cried Emma, collecting herself resolutelyLet us understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake."	"austen"
"The horror of being blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them."	"austen"
"I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage."	"austen"
"dearI think you play the best of the two."	"austen"
"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?"	"austen"
"Aye, we men are sad fellows."	"austen"
"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly."	"austen"
"A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her friend related."	"austen"
"Knightley must not marry!You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?Oh!"	"austen"
"If he would act in this sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend to his."	"austen"
"They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the Donwell road."	"austen"
"That Emma was his object appeared indisputable."	"austen"
"Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me."	"austen"
"A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial."	"austen"
"Weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when all the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and sympathiser."	"austen"
"I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours."	"austen"
"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome."	"austen"
"I could not excuse a man's having more music than lovemore ear than eyea more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings."	"austen"
"Selina is no fine lady, I assure you."	"austen"
"To Highbury in general it brought no material change."	"austen"
"Have not you mistaken the day?"	"austen"
"Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he will have the advantage over negligent superiority."	"austen"
"Come on a donkey, however, if you prefer it."	"austen"
"Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her own."	"austen"
"It was not unlikely, she thought, that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in while she were paying her visit."	"austen"
"And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent oneand who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself or settling his accounts."	"austen"
"With the view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said, You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two."	"austen"
"Her approbation, at once general and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the future."	"austen"
"She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself."	"austen"
"In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself."	"austen"
"The manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them."	"austen"
"I assure you she did."	"austen"
"If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself."	"austen"
"To walk by the side of this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been acting just then without design; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her."	"austen"
"Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney, and too stupid to rise."	"austen"
"My courage rises while I write."	"austen"
"He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.Emma saw it."	"austen"
"What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature?"	"austen"
"They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made happy;from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her."	"austen"
"The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints."	"austen"
"If I had but her memory!"	"austen"
"a word to the wise.I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I?"	"austen"
"Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction may be the greater."	"austen"
"Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she could still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without her."	"austen"
"See the consequence of keeping you company!What do you say to it?"	"austen"
"He cannot want moneyhe cannot want leisure."	"austen"
"To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma."	"austen"
"According to Miss Batesit all came from herMrs."	"austen"
"Every invitation was successful."	"austen"
"All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed."	"austen"
"You persuaded her to refuse him."	"austen"
"When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind."	"austen"
"She will think Frank ought to ask her."	"austen"
"I condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a blank to me.'"	"austen"
"If not in our dispositions, she presently added, with a look of true sensibility, there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own."	"austen"
"She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say, It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton going to be married!"	"austen"
"I will not say quite all."	"austen"
"Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardensall the gardens?She wished to see the whole extent.The pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear."	"austen"
"Her way was clear, though not quite smooth.She spoke then, on being so entreated.What did she say?Just what she ought, of course."	"austen"
"I have always admired her complexion, replied Emma, archly; but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?When we first began to talk of her.Have you quite forgotten?"	"austen"
"was not that her own doing too?"	"austen"
"What arises from discretion must be honoured."	"austen"
"Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the single men, had already taken place."	"austen"
"They shew her to the greatest advantage."	"austen"
"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there can be no use in canvassing it."	"austen"
"And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning."	"austen"
"She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected, she could be fit for nothing rational."	"austen"
"There will be enough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need."	"austen"
"I am sure I must have been as white as my gown."	"austen"
"And as to my poor word 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it."	"austen"
"Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on."	"austen"
"You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage."	"austen"
"This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only from herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston."	"austen"
"It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two parcels."	"austen"
"How that visit was to be acknowledgedwhat would be necessaryand what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration."	"austen"
"Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some other time, but it will not do now."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax."	"austen"
"Do you dare say this?"	"austen"
"The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the poor little boys, or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how beautifully Emma had written it."	"austen"
"When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better, for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object."	"austen"
"Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry."	"austen"
"There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it not."	"austen"
"And when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again; and you had better name an early hour."	"austen"
"She should then have heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge."	"austen"
"The chances are that she must be a gainer."	"austen"
"you are too obliging!"	"austen"
"But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposingthat ifstrange as it may appear."	"austen"
"I shall go abroad for a couple of yearsand when I return, I shall come to you for my wife."	"austen"
"No, not true on your side."	"austen"
"With respect to her father, it was a question soon answered."	"austen"
"It need not detain us long."	"austen"
"With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued: You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect."	"austen"
"CHAPTER XIV What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out!she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering;she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away."	"austen"
"I certainly get better and better.Now for it."	"austen"
"She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball taken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill-health."	"austen"
"No, sir, replied his son, laughing, I seem to have had it from nobody.Very odd!I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all these particularsbut as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream."	"austen"
"The party was to be our brother and sister, Henry, Johnand Miss Smith."	"austen"
"Then here is my last,unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size, whole-lengthmy last and my bestmy brother, Mr. John Knightley.This did not want much of being finished, when I put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness."	"austen"
"She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home."	"austen"
"Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot."	"austen"
"Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin's cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl, with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.Much of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for."	"austen"
"Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody."	"austen"
"She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state."	"austen"
"CHAPTER XI It may be possible to do without dancing entirely."	"austen"
"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!"	"austen"
"Vanity, extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became liable to all these charges."	"austen"
"Your neighbourhood is increasing, and you mix more with it."	"austen"
"She read, and was surprized."	"austen"
"I am always glad to see him."	"austen"
"Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make me."	"austen"
"And a delightful dance it was to be."	"austen"
"And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper."	"austen"
"They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.The sphere in which she moves is much above his.It would be a degradation."	"austen"
"A worthy employment for a young lady's mind!"	"austen"
"Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately?"	"austen"
"He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and which had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must be very like a merit to those he was with."	"austen"
"Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally."	"austen"
"Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?"	"austen"
"Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage."	"austen"
"I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm."	"austen"
"There I was quite right."	"austen"
"Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion."	"austen"
"But do not imagine that I want to influence you."	"austen"
"Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say, with a very interesting naivete, Oh!"	"austen"
"Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible."	"austen"
"Besides, if she does play so very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to teach."	"austen"
"Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristolmerchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also."	"austen"
"He had come, in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's engagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.The rest had been the work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings."	"austen"
"She hoped no one could have said to her, How could you be so unfeeling to your father?I must, I will tell you truths while I can."	"austen"
"But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner."	"austen"
"I like your plan, cried Mr. Weston."	"austen"
"Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few minutes silence, he said, Another thing must be taken into consideration tooMrs."	"austen"
"My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well."	"austen"
"Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove."	"austen"
"It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling."	"austen"
"He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so herself, though she would not own it."	"austen"
"This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed."	"austen"
"He will be able to tell her how we all are."	"austen"
"You have drawn two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a thirda something between the do-nothing and the do-all."	"austen"
"The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her."	"austen"
"How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr. Knightley!How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!But Harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.Her inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton's being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.Alas!"	"austen"
"Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles."	"austen"
"There is safety in reserve, but no attraction."	"austen"
"I give you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on the subject."	"austen"
"Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an examination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note."	"austen"
"and very much to the purpose."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton was only too happy."	"austen"
"You blush, Harriet.Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition?"	"austen"
"She looked back as well as she could; but it was all confusion."	"austen"
"Short of that, it is all guess and luckand will generally be ill-luck."	"austen"
"My behaviour, during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point."	"austen"
"I left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot."	"austen"
"I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head."	"austen"
"Wax-candles in the schoolroom!"	"austen"
"Let my father's servant go with you.Let me order the carriage."	"austen"
"But she was always right."	"austen"
"Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent."	"austen"
"She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill, and every thing left far behind."	"austen"
"I was the most miserable wretch!"	"austen"
"I will call another day, and hear the pianoforte."	"austen"
"But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachmentwhether there were no actual preferenceremained a little longer doubtful."	"austen"
"He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey."	"austen"
"She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together."	"austen"
"My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping."	"austen"
"I mean in persontall, and with that sort of lookand not very talkative."	"austen"
"She thinks nobody equal to him."	"austen"
"Exquisite, quite exquisite!Still, however, having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up."	"austen"
"When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had undervalued their strength."	"austen"
"Emma thought first of herself, and then of Harriet."	"austen"
"The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons' reception of it tried."	"austen"
"Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change."	"austen"
"But I shall want the ribbon directlyso it had better go to Hartfieldat least the ribbon."	"austen"
"I do not pretend to it."	"austen"
"Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please; she will now have but one."	"austen"
"Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend."	"austen"
"And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for."	"austen"
"It was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and was destined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece."	"austen"
"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened."	"austen"
"Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours."	"austen"
"He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her."	"austen"
"His aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting over to them.Mrs."	"austen"
"Emma knew what was coming; they must have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies' ball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward to prevent Harriet's being obliged to say a word."	"austen"
"Yesit seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs. Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world."	"austen"
"That was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and chance."	"austen"
"These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present."	"austen"
"You do not often overpower me with it."	"austen"
"It was natural for him to feel that he had cause to sigh."	"austen"
"When Frank left us, continued he, it was quite uncertain when we might see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome."	"austen"
"His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own."	"austen"
"You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour be the rule of mineand so I have."	"austen"
"He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected blow."	"austen"
"I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my son's hand, presumed to open itthough it was not directed to meit was to Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself."	"austen"
"This is feeling your way."	"austen"
"Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeatedor two things moderately cleveror three things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily at them all."	"austen"
"Emma even jumped with surprize;and, horror-struck, exclaimed, Jane Fairfax!Good God!"	"austen"
"And I am quite serious too, I assure you, replied Mrs. Elton gaily, in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us."	"austen"
"He did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing and noticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) he could with time persuade her to any thing."	"austen"
"If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends for it."	"austen"
"He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices."	"austen"
"A little while ago, every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown."	"austen"
"turning away distressed."	"austen"
"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting."	"austen"
"I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin."	"austen"
"Did not keep the horses a moment."	"austen"
"I must have given you up."	"austen"
"I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely."	"austen"
"I care for nothing else."	"austen"
"Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?"	"austen"
"You may guess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once."	"austen"
"Part only of this answer, however, was admitted."	"austen"
"If a separation of two months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils before her:caution for him and for herself would be necessary."	"austen"
"The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her shouldersand it makes one think she must catch cold."	"austen"
"but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such obscurity, so thrown away.Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end!"	"austen"
"He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be laid before Emma."	"austen"
"Delighted to hear it indeed."	"austen"
"He told Patty this, but bid her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs. Hodges would be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder."	"austen"
"Harriet may pick and chuse."	"austen"
"I am sure you did not much expect to like us."	"austen"
"Pray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircaserather darker and narrower than one could wish."	"austen"
"I have done with match-making indeed."	"austen"
"She calls you, Knightleywhat can she do for Mr. Cole?"	"austen"
"While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter."	"austen"
"To be sure we do, cried his father; Mrs. Bateswe passed her houseI saw Miss Bates at the window."	"austen"
"But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father!"	"austen"
"Fairfax of the regiment of infantry, and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroadof his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwardsand this girl."	"austen"
"Is not she an angel in every gesture?"	"austen"
"No, my dear little modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow."	"austen"
"It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first remark, on reading it, was that of course it must be declined, she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful."	"austen"
"We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year."	"austen"
"I should not have thought it possible, she began, that you could have misunderstood me!"	"austen"
"He was wishing to confide in herperhaps to consult her;cost her what it would, she would listen."	"austen"
"replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, what is the certainty of caprice?"	"austen"
"He had, by that time, realised an easy competenceenough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed forenough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition."	"austen"
"The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to."	"austen"
"He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber again, for the presentto entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston, capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top."	"austen"
"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it."	"austen"
"'I did not make the allowances,' said she, 'which I ought to have done, for his temper and spiritshis delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.'"	"austen"
"But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time."	"austen"
"She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there."	"austen"
"It was accepted; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother from time to time."	"austen"
"Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings."	"austen"
"I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor?"	"austen"
"Emma watched them in, and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,trying, with all the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern."	"austen"
"I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"He came to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it."	"austen"
"I could not walk half so far."	"austen"
"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so many months, continued Mrs. Weston, she was energetic."	"austen"
"His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their mutual good to outweigh every drawback."	"austen"
"It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another.It was his object to blind all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myselfexcept that I was not blindedthat it was my good fortunethat, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him."	"austen"
"She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments."	"austen"
"Soft is the very word for her eyeof all epithets, the justest that could be given."	"austen"
"I remember it perfectly."	"austen"
"There was merit in every drawingin the least finished, perhaps the most; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same."	"austen"
"He has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"They met with the utmost friendliness."	"austen"
"But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!I hate the recollection."	"austen"
"Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent."	"austen"
"There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Laneturning a corner which he could never bear to think ofand in strange handsa mere common coachmanno James; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr. John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father, as to seemif not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruelperfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party, except herself.But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection."	"austen"
"They separated too much into parties."	"austen"
"Emma's answer was ready at the first word."	"austen"
"But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short, they would both be soon after her."	"austen"
"Quite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night."	"austen"
"Oh!you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me himself."	"austen"
"After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he replied, If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that already."	"austen"
"said Emma in a whisper."	"austen"
"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and resolution."	"austen"
"was her immediate exclamation."	"austen"
"You will hardly believe mebut twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses."	"austen"
"She must laugh at such a close!"	"austen"
"Emma could not forgive her."	"austen"
"I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural."	"austen"
"But poor Harriet could not follow."	"austen"
"She had no sense of superiority then."	"austen"
"She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany her own voice well."	"austen"
"After a little more discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection, It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here."	"austen"
"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment."	"austen"
"I was not aware of it myself."	"austen"
"They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet."	"austen"
"He walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"A man, said he, must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as this, for the sake of coming to see him."	"austen"
"Now, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people; and the PerrysI suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry."	"austen"
"Natural enough!his own mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it in others.Mystery; Finessehow they pervert the understanding!"	"austen"
"That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents."	"austen"
"But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time."	"austen"
"Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation."	"austen"
"However, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose."	"austen"
"Emma could not think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh."	"austen"
"A small half-glass, put into a tumbler of water?"	"austen"
"She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?"	"austen"
"You appear to feel a great dealbut I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known her longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act."	"austen"
"There had been no real affection either in his language or manners."	"austen"
"When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for."	"austen"
"She had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to."	"austen"
"A Miss Hawkins I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago."	"austen"
"And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good time."	"austen"
"One cannot have too large a party."	"austen"
"One would fancy we were bosom friends!"	"austen"
"A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear."	"austen"
"The prospect before her now, was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelledthat might not be even partially brightened."	"austen"
"The stupidest fellow!"	"austen"
"She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside."	"austen"
"I always say a woman cannot have too many resourcesand I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society."	"austen"
"As he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority."	"austen"
"She was sorry, very sorry."	"austen"
"I feel that all the apologies should be on my side."	"austen"
"A circumstance rather unlucky occurred."	"austen"
"Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband, she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them."	"austen"
"One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain."	"austen"
"But I must be more in want of a friend, or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one."	"austen"
"It did not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday."	"austen"
"However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife."	"austen"
"I always take the part of my own sex."	"austen"
"He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can."	"austen"
"There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not: and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet."	"austen"
"Yeswhat should hurt me?I walk fast."	"austen"
"Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only accomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank Churchill entered the room."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly."	"austen"
"She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very feeling tone, This is most kind, indeed!Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me to expressI hope you will believeExcuse me for being so entirely without words."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness."	"austen"
"You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have been very bad, but for Perry's great attention."	"austen"
"The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.She never could have deserved himand nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible."	"austen"
"Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose Indeed I am not so mad.But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distanceand to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so proper, in me especially."	"austen"
"She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell's return."	"austen"
"He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing elsewhich is just as it should be, for a thriving man."	"austen"
"Yes, said John Knightley, and I think we shall have a good deal of it."	"austen"
"And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else."	"austen"
"She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt on, It might be distressing, for the moment, said she; but you seem to have behaved extremely well; and it is overand may nevercan never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about it."	"austen"
"I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her wayallowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing to be as she likes)."	"austen"
"If ever there were people who, without having great wealth themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us."	"austen"
"It is very pretty, said Mr. Woodhouse."	"austen"
"Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father."	"austen"
"The plan of a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his cooler manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness."	"austen"
"He had gone away rejected and mortifieddisappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one."	"austen"
"As soon as she came to her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment."	"austen"
"But Jane, it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it."	"austen"
"When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed, It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us."	"austen"
"At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen."	"austen"
"His good sense and good principles would delight you.As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in better hands."	"austen"
"They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose."	"austen"
"What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hillwhich messenger, however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace, and driving very steady."	"austen"
"She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than she used to beAnd I love an open temper."	"austen"
"CHAPTER III Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way."	"austen"
"Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's complaint;a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often alarmed her with them."	"austen"
"It is a pity that they were ever got over."	"austen"
"It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood."	"austen"
"The fever was over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy."	"austen"
"The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative, and who was always the greater talker."	"austen"
"His lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity."	"austen"
"In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;and very long walks, you knowin summer there is dust, and in winter there is dirt."	"austen"
"People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families."	"austen"
"They were all disengaged and all happy.The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet over."	"austen"
"He was coming through the hall."	"austen"
"I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith."	"austen"
"And who do you think came in while we were there?"	"austen"
"If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can be?"	"austen"
"Former provocations reappeared."	"austen"
"When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with, Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit?"	"austen"
"He had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country."	"austen"
"Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always happy with pleasant companions."	"austen"
"But still he went on measuring, and still he ended with, I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple."	"austen"
"Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault."	"austen"
"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just what you ought."	"austen"
"Acquit me here, and procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly affection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight, you have now a key to."	"austen"
"She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.She ought to goand she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill."	"austen"
"Nothing should separate her from her father."	"austen"
"Pain is no expiation."	"austen"
"I have some hope, resumed he, of my uncle's being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her."	"austen"
"They were sneering and negligent."	"austen"
"Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remainedin the law linenothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him, than that he was in the law line; and with him the daughter had lived."	"austen"
"said she.The regularity and despatch of it!"	"austen"
"While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose."	"austen"
"I should like to see Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good."	"austen"
"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head."	"austen"
"I was desired to say so from both."	"austen"
"She blessed the favouring blindness."	"austen"
"She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour."	"austen"
"Besides the Eltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of courseand it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth:but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it."	"austen"
"I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will be."	"austen"
"They may be induced to go too."	"austen"
"No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character."	"austen"
"I say nothing of which I am ashamed, replied he, with lively impudence."	"austen"
"cried Mr. Weston, about Perry and a carriage?"	"austen"
"I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon."	"austen"
"Some part of his conduct we cannot excuse."	"austen"
"It was quite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls."	"austen"
"You never wrote a truer line."	"austen"
"Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome."	"austen"
"And she, Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton."	"austen"
"How did you think the Coxes looked?"	"austen"
"If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur something."	"austen"
"He could not believe her to be encouraging him."	"austen"
"So do I, said Mrs. Weston gently, very much."	"austen"
"yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury."	"austen"
"Short had been the noticeshort their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too much."	"austen"
"Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the Very true, my love, which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all."	"austen"
"Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could, and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, My good friend, this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there from the Crown in a hop, step, and jump."	"austen"
"I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town."	"austen"
"And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from the seaa quarter of a mile offvery comfortable."	"austen"
"I must confess it is a recommendation to me."	"austen"
"He is desperately in love and means to marry her."	"austen"
"Miss Woodhouse, why are you always so right?"	"austen"
"She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share."	"austen"
"What did Mr. Weston tell you?said Emma, still perplexed."	"austen"
"Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?was a question, however, which did not augur much."	"austen"
"My Emma, he means no such thing."	"austen"
"There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment, said she, that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions."	"austen"
"If I could but see her again!But I must not propose it yet."	"austen"
"Emma had not another word to oppose."	"austen"
"I leave you to your own reflections."	"austen"
"Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible."	"austen"
"you will never guess."	"austen"
"I almost long to attempt her likeness myself."	"austen"
"Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could."	"austen"
"Dear Miss Woodhouse!and Dear Miss Woodhouse, was all that Harriet, with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as she ought."	"austen"
"The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.Mr."	"austen"
"I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my lifenever looking so well."	"austen"
"You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to them, by interference."	"austen"
"But, upon my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself."	"austen"
"Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been.Mr."	"austen"
"You will not regard being tired."	"austen"
"I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls."	"austen"
"But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom from home."	"austen"
"I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had really made a very good likeness of it(Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it very like)only too handsometoo flatteringbut that was a fault on the right sideafter all this, came poor dear Isabella's cold approbation ofYes, it was a little likebut to be sure it did not do him justice."	"austen"
"The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible to every body."	"austen"
"They will be so near their own stable."	"austen"
"He would be always coming over."	"austen"
"Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this apology for Jane."	"austen"
"Frank Churchillmust put up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two years' absence."	"austen"
"He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend his evening at Hartfield."	"austen"
"Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well."	"austen"
"His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved."	"austen"
"And is she, at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives?"	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley, is not she?"	"austen"
"The coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expectedshe did not herself expectthat any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers."	"austen"
"Just as your drawings always are, my dear."	"austen"
"Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference, had produced this very natural and very desirable effect."	"austen"
"aye, I know your scruples."	"austen"
"And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.She promised Wright a receipt, and never sent it."	"austen"
"Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to, pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will."	"austen"
"And you can be always with me."	"austen"
"She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the Abbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again so soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future."	"austen"
"Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon's actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first."	"austen"
"Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting; but still they were to part."	"austen"
"She was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives."	"austen"
"She thought it would be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her to have much merit in planning it."	"austen"
"Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings."	"austen"
"I have quite a horror of upstarts."	"austen"
"the letter had much better be all your own."	"austen"
"I have never seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton."	"austen"
"He was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably."	"austen"
"The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence."	"austen"
"He is very obliging, said Emma; but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him?"	"austen"
"Exactly soThe shape of the eye and the lines about the mouthI have not a doubt of your success."	"austen"
"But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.And I could take the pattern gown home any day."	"austen"
"She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he tried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed Charming Miss Woodhouse!"	"austen"
"Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant."	"austen"
"But I thought you would."	"austen"
"I am making a conundrum."	"austen"
"Mr. Perry has been with her, as you probably heard."	"austen"
"It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment."	"austen"
"She wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturally belong to their friendship."	"austen"
"This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;not like Mr. Elton."	"austen"
"Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied, That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before."	"austen"
"Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear."	"austen"
"CHAPTER X The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment, slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax, standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte."	"austen"
"She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, as if it had passed within the same apartment."	"austen"
"I wish we could contrive it, said she; but I cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in;no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeperno message from my father."	"austen"
"You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment."	"austen"
"I have no doubt of their being happy together, said Emma; I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached."	"austen"
"Upon my word, she cried, the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking."	"austen"
"A hasty and imprudent attachment may arisebut there is generally time to recover from it afterwards."	"austen"
"But that would not do."	"austen"
"I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the enclosed."	"austen"
"And that is all that I can recollect of itbut it is very clever all the way through."	"austen"
"In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not always listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed."	"austen"
"Well, pretty good news, is not it?"	"austen"
"I have thought only of you."	"austen"
"It is a sort of thing, cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, which I should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into."	"austen"
"He could not say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable kindness added, You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out of luck; you are very much out of luck!"	"austen"
"They must keep as much together as they could; and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage."	"austen"
"We never heard of such things at Maple Grove."	"austen"
"He left me not half an hour ago."	"austen"
"Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to readnot even of Mrs. Elton."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded."	"austen"
"She thought it was time to make up."	"austen"
"As far as good intentions went, we were both right, and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong."	"austen"
"I saw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other."	"austen"
"It seemed at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied."	"austen"
"No indeed!There was not a hint of Mr. Martin."	"austen"
"I went in for three minutes, and was detained by Miss Bates's being absent."	"austen"
"Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst."	"austen"
"Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure."	"austen"
"I never knew days fly so fast."	"austen"
"Mrs. Elton's invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting."	"austen"
"One of those points on which his influence failed, he then mentioned."	"austen"
"To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply, than, Very well."	"austen"
"Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well, nor valued her affection so highly before."	"austen"
"Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she replied, I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton."	"austen"
"But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear."	"austen"
"Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible."	"austen"
"What news do you mean?"	"austen"
"Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back!"	"austen"
"Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her, to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly folliesher wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a subject.She could not enter on it.Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them."	"austen"
"Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and meand my caro sposo walking by."	"austen"
"He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said, Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it."	"austen"
"But I will shew her greater attention than I have done."	"austen"
"CHAPTER III This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure."	"austen"
"Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will."	"austen"
"As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit."	"austen"
"How does Miss Smith do?"	"austen"
"Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another syllable passed.Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night."	"austen"
"I want you to call me something else, but I do not know what."	"austen"
"Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier;it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyedbut it might have happened at a better timeand to have had longer notice of it, would have been pleasanter.They parted thorough friends, however; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished gallantry;it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion.He had been sitting with them half an hour, she found."	"austen"
"To talk would be only to irritate.She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of othersshe objected only to a tete-a-tetethey might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.Harriet submitted, and approved, and was grateful."	"austen"
"Emma was most agreeably surprized.Mr."	"austen"
"With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever."	"austen"
"Could he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and language at parting would have been different.Still, however, I must be on my guard."	"austen"
"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject, replied Emma, smiling; but you do not mean to deny that there was a timeand not very distant eitherwhen you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him?"	"austen"
"It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment; never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her."	"austen"
"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational, unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their own concerns."	"austen"
"I was sure it could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table."	"austen"
"At the same time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspiredMiss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly."	"austen"
"She says I fidget her to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same."	"austen"
"And now I come to the principal, the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires very solicitous explanation."	"austen"
"However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it overbut these sort of things require a good deal of consideration."	"austen"
"I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: but we are so remarkably airy!Mr."	"austen"
"And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield."	"austen"
"I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the first circle."	"austen"
"You think so, do you?I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge."	"austen"
"No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before."	"austen"
"But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success?"	"austen"
"Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.The Mr. Churchills were also in town; and they were only waiting for November."	"austen"
"We really are so shocked!"	"austen"
"They have no mercy on her."	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused."	"austen"
"She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, and understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people."	"austen"
"Emma could not doubt."	"austen"
"Emma thought at least it would turn out so."	"austen"
"It soon appeared that London was not the place for her."	"austen"
"After another short hesitation, I hope it does not proceed fromI hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?"	"austen"
"Were I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing!"	"austen"
"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goosethe finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen."	"austen"
"Emma encouraged her talkativenessamused by such a picture of another set of beings, and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin's having two parlours, two very good parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it, it should be called her cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink tea:a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people."	"austen"
"that ball!why did we wait for any thing?why not seize the pleasure at once?How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation!You told us it would be so.Oh!"	"austen"
"He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London."	"austen"
"This is very true, said she, at least as far as relates to me, which was all that was meantand it is very shameful.Of the same ageand always knowing herI ought to have been more her friend.She will never like me now."	"austen"
"Did she know?had she heard any thing about her, since their being at Randalls?he felt much anxietyhe must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably."	"austen"
"We always say what we like to one another."	"austen"
"I like them extremely."	"austen"
"Walk home!you are prettily shod for walking home, I dare say."	"austen"
"If all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness."	"austen"
"Here am I come down for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!When did it happen before, or any thing like it?"	"austen"
"As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get at her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again, with any necessity, or even any power of speech."	"austen"
"But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.Shocking plan, living together."	"austen"
"But did you never see him?"	"austen"
"Just as it should be, said Mr. John Knightley, and just as I hoped it was from your letters."	"austen"
"I hope every body had a pleasant evening, said Mr. Woodhouse, in his quiet way."	"austen"
"Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own!"	"austen"
"They were interrupted."	"austen"
"The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most prominent feeling."	"austen"
"There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so leniently disposed."	"austen"
"Such things do occur, undoubtedly.She was stopped by a cough."	"austen"
"I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing."	"austen"
"I cannot imagine, said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do,) I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of all people in the world!"	"austen"
"At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma's brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther discovery, You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time."	"austen"
"Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days."	"austen"
"Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never came out again."	"austen"
"I forget where we had been walking tovery likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls."	"austen"
"said she, quickly, looking up in his face."	"austen"
"This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he stood up, in tall indignation, and said, Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her."	"austen"
"That there was to be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the idea of another."	"austen"
"I have the pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles, healed for the present."	"austen"
"madam, cried Emma, if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly earned."	"austen"
"That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof."	"austen"
"Open the windows!but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls."	"austen"
"He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma was convinced that it had been so."	"austen"
"and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas."	"austen"
"Well, now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her."	"austen"
"With their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house, their inclination for more company."	"austen"
"One says those sort of things, of course, without any idea of a serious meaning."	"austen"
"I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly throughand very good lists they werevery well chosen, and very neatly arrangedsometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule."	"austen"
"She felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her."	"austen"
"Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her forcibly."	"austen"
"Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston."	"austen"
"Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?"	"austen"
"You will know it all in time."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good; and his many inquiries after poor Isabella and her children were answered most satisfactorily."	"austen"
"It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way."	"austen"
"Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it."	"austen"
"I do not advise the custard."	"austen"
"It was owing to her persuasion, as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm."	"austen"
"Well, what do you say to it?I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?In town next week, you seeat the latest, I dare say; for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday."	"austen"
"I think, indeed, said John Knightley pleasantly, that Mr. Weston has some little claim."	"austen"
"I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she will send for Perry."	"austen"
"My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.I must still add to this long letter."	"austen"
"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people."	"austen"
"said she, I get quite anxious about you."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston was chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation."	"austen"
"What is to become of that?Very true."	"austen"
"And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday followingas you will find from Jane's letter."	"austen"
"Well, Miss Woodhouse, he almost immediately began, your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors of my father's little rooms."	"austen"
"Yes, my dear, if there is time.But(in a very depressed tone)she is coming for only one week."	"austen"
"Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose."	"austen"
"The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an introductionof her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs. Elton'sprobably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!"	"austen"
"To take herbe it only an hour or twofrom her aunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language she could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would namementioning that she had Mr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient."	"austen"
"Now do not you feel that you had?"	"austen"
"Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill's going, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence."	"austen"
"She understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will."	"austen"
"She was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day."	"austen"
"He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient familyand that the Eltons were nobody."	"austen"
"But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses."	"austen"
"Every body seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this."	"austen"
"If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not imagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him."	"austen"
"My dear Jane, are you sure you did not wet your feet?It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremelyand there was a mat to step uponI shall never forget his extreme politeness.Oh!"	"austen"
"But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of that sort his master had; he had brought them alland now his master had not one left to bake or boil."	"austen"
"CHAPTER II Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family, which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property."	"austen"
"She hardly knew what to say."	"austen"
"By your account, he does seem to have had some scruples."	"austen"
"It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away."	"austen"
"I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration."	"austen"
"You got Hannah that good place."	"austen"
"I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning."	"austen"
"Harriet turned away; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a pushof having thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up."	"austen"
"With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument, to listen."	"austen"
"She read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness."	"austen"
"The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall."	"austen"
"I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between themcertain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public."	"austen"
"I was quite surprized;very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized."	"austen"
"Come, he knows himself there."	"austen"
"That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure."	"austen"
"I knew it wasbut had not resolution enough to part with them."	"austen"
"However, it was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of pleasure."	"austen"
"And the same may be said of Mrs. JeffereysClara Partridge, that wasand of the two Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate."	"austen"
"Frank Churchill's character was not desperate.She was his own Emma, by hand and word, when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow."	"austen"
"If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it between September and January."	"austen"
"Emma grew sick at the sound."	"austen"
"Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance."	"austen"
"Other poultry-yards in the neighbourhood also suffered.Pilfering was housebreaking to Mr. Woodhouse's fears.He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston, you would be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing."	"austen"
"He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about."	"austen"
"she cried.Well!Then having recourse to her workbasket, in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing, she added, Well, now tell me every thing; make this intelligible to me."	"austen"
"As a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer character,) she was truly welcome."	"austen"
"And as to its recommendations to you, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them."	"austen"
"Quite wonderful how she does her hair!No hairdresser from London I think could.Ah!"	"austen"
"Her influence would have been enough."	"austen"
"A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,) than I had expected."	"austen"
"Well, Miss Woodhouse!"	"austen"
"If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view or his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow."	"austen"
"Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again; and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject."	"austen"
"It was almost enough to make her think of marrying."	"austen"
"I am not at all afraid."	"austen"
"I know the danger of indulging such speculations."	"austen"
"A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old maid!"	"austen"
"Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded."	"austen"
"She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it."	"austen"
"Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am gone?"	"austen"
"You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general."	"austen"
"He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up his time or his heart."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!It was a union to distance every wonder of the kind.The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or thought.Mr."	"austen"
"A piece of paper was found on the table this morning(dropt, we suppose, by a fairy)containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied it in."	"austen"
"You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from her, on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor."	"austen"
"A lady always does.She said enough to shew there need not be despairand to invite him to say more himself."	"austen"
"Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals."	"austen"
"You did behave very shamefully."	"austen"
"He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him, that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting."	"austen"
"She had never rejoiced at the sound before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs, with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule."	"austen"
"I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever."	"austen"
"We shall not be many, you know."	"austen"
"But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago."	"austen"
"no, said he; it would be the extreme of imprudence."	"austen"
"'I remember that perfectly."	"austen"
"Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations?"	"austen"
"And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too."	"austen"
"CHAPTER IX Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eyehe seemed watching her intentlyin vain, however, if it were soJane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither."	"austen"
"What a letter the man writes!"	"austen"
"But they live very comfortably."	"austen"
"I hope he will not mind it so very much."	"austen"
"Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him."	"austen"
"Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be."	"austen"
"Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs. Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough for safety, had led them into alarm.About half a mile beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies."	"austen"
"The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them."	"austen"
"Your parish there was small, said Jane."	"austen"
"are you there?But you are miserably behindhand."	"austen"
"There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive scheme."	"austen"
"I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing, then another, there is no saying what, you know."	"austen"
"They were entering the hall."	"austen"
"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who have always set him the example of it."	"austen"
"It is certainly very well regulated."	"austen"
"I am afraid we must be running away, said Emma, glancing at Harriet, and beginning to riseMy father will be expecting us."	"austen"
"He continued, Depend upon it, Elton will not do."	"austen"
"but what shall you do?"	"austen"
"Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party."	"austen"
"Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all."	"austen"
"I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what they are."	"austen"
"I have nothing more to shew you, or to sayexcept that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see me do it."	"austen"
"He may be very 'amiable,' have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about him."	"austen"
"I had not the least idea!Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation, she had come to the resolution of accepting it.I did not know a word of it till it was all settled."	"austen"
"Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more composure, You probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have had your suspicions.I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.I wish I had attended to itbut(with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness."	"austen"
"Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves."	"austen"
"She could not bear to see him suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress would be soon over too, she hesitatedshe could not proceed."	"austen"
"Me, my love, cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part."	"austen"
"Jane actually on the point of going as governess!"	"austen"
"For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three months later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner."	"austen"
"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me?"	"austen"
"It was no more than a wish."	"austen"
"Here,probably this basket with pink ribbon."	"austen"
"When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston seems an excellent creaturequite a first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you."	"austen"
"Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax?"	"austen"
"Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return."	"austen"
"On this point we have been wretched."	"austen"
"They would have solicited the honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company."	"austen"
"I know that is the feeling of you all."	"austen"
"Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister."	"austen"
"I am sure, a month ago, I had no more idea myself!The strangest things do take place!"	"austen"
"Butthat he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry him!should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!look down upon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below him, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!It was most provoking."	"austen"
"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer."	"austen"
"He owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause."	"austen"
"With him it was most unnatural."	"austen"
"There, papa!Now you must be satisfiedOur own dear Mrs. Weston, who is carefulness itself."	"austen"
"As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can."	"austen"
"I wanted to keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was aware."	"austen"
"Early, I know, you had none."	"austen"
"She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself."	"austen"
"Engaged since October,secretly engaged.It has hurt me, Emma, very much."	"austen"
"He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on her face."	"austen"
"We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or other."	"austen"
"Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow."	"austen"
"You must be the best judge of your own happiness."	"austen"
"They were going to remove immediately to Richmond."	"austen"
"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints."	"austen"
"By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over, she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice."	"austen"
"She was short, plump, and fair, with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the acquaintance."	"austen"
"Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner."	"austen"
"Where is the young man?"	"austen"
"The black mare was blameless; they were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause."	"austen"
"I am only afraid of your sitting up for me."	"austen"
"'My dear,' said I, 'you will blind yourself'for tears were in her eyes perpetually."	"austen"
"If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had."	"austen"
"You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other."	"austen"
"And, by the bye, every body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed."	"austen"
"You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these ten years."	"austen"
"Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises."	"austen"
"I am sure I never suspected it, you did it so naturally."	"austen"
"Only think of those sweet verses'To Miss .'"	"austen"
"We shall have no occasion to open the windows at allnot once the whole evening; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief."	"austen"
"The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day."	"austen"
"You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure."	"austen"
"I hope she is right.In one respect, my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself, Your obliged and affectionate Son, F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL."	"austen"
"Dear affectionate creature!You banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!You confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!"	"austen"
"And soon afterwards, Jane Fairfax is a very charming young womanbut not even Jane Fairfax is perfect."	"austen"
"Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a Schoolnot of a seminary, or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new principles and new systemsand where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanitybut a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies."	"austen"
"In that case, nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on."	"austen"
"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone."	"austen"
"After this, he made some progress without any pause."	"austen"
"Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed!"	"austen"
"Had she been a person of consequence herself, he would have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he did or no."	"austen"
"But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance proportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an additional proof of his knowing how to pleaseand of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her."	"austen"
"I hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it."	"austen"
"By that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting awayand thenonly think!I found he was coming up towards me tooslowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and so he came and spoke, and I answeredand I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I was going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain."	"austen"
"He looked rather doubtinglyrather confused; said something about honour,glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively."	"austen"
"I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous."	"austen"
"Were you often in the same society?"	"austen"
"My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you."	"austen"
"When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring."	"austen"
"Wellif you advise it.But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an indifferent tonewhat shall I say?"	"austen"
"Is not she looking well?"	"austen"
"An abominable puppy!You know who I mean (nodding to her husband)."	"austen"
"Their intercourse was painful enough by letter."	"austen"
"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount."	"austen"
"Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many more."	"austen"
"To speak, she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness."	"austen"
"She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them."	"austen"
"He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and her tongue motionless."	"austen"
"His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would be quite enough to account for the horses."	"austen"
"she cried with more thorough gaiety, if you fancy your brother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret, and hear his opinion."	"austen"
"I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with him."	"austen"
"I always fetch the letters when I am here."	"austen"
"There was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in soundfor Mr. Weston immediately accosted her with, How d'ye do?how d'ye do?We have been sitting with your fatherglad to see him so well."	"austen"
"In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,the weather appearing exactly right."	"austen"
"he could ride to London at any time."	"austen"
"I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her."	"austen"
"She knew the importance of it, and said every thing in her power to do it away."	"austen"
"She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of hersone to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault."	"austen"
"I should like to see two more here,your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my sonand then I should say we were quite complete."	"austen"
"She was good enough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highburyhandsome enoughto look plain, probably, by Harriet's side."	"austen"
"The heat even would be danger.You are fatigued already."	"austen"
"I am amazed that you should think of such a thing."	"austen"
"He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered (especially since your making so much of her) as in a line of society above him."	"austen"
"How I could so long a time be fancying myself!..."	"austen"
"She had been often remiss, her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact; scornful, ungracious."	"austen"
"She was obliged, in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold."	"austen"
"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended."	"austen"
"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your fatheror even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately."	"austen"
"Witness this very time."	"austen"
"I do not know which it ought to be called."	"austen"
"The expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know."	"austen"
"The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe."	"austen"
"Dancing with open windows!I am sure, neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer it."	"austen"
"She had no scruple with regard to him."	"austen"
"What does all that signify?"	"austen"
"Well, Mrs. Weston, said Emma triumphantly when he left them, what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?"	"austen"
"It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly; (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.)"	"austen"
"Do come with me, said Mrs. Weston, if it be not very disagreeable to you."	"austen"
"my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.Better not move at all, better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air."	"austen"
"She would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life."	"austen"
"I was very much pleased with all that he said."	"austen"
"Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin."	"austen"
"He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern."	"austen"
"There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking."	"austen"
"Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November."	"austen"
"I told you that your suspicions would guide mine."	"austen"
"I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were notfor a few weeks at least."	"austen"
"My report from Mrs. Goddard's, said she presently, was not so pleasant as I had hoped'Not better' was my answer."	"austen"
"He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of censure."	"austen"
"The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its meaning change."	"austen"
"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure at Highbury."	"austen"
"That is too young to settle."	"austen"
"The quiet, heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her daughterwho proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene."	"austen"
"They were combined only of anger against herself, mortification, and deep concern."	"austen"
"And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance."	"austen"
"Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife's: his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance and insolence!"	"austen"
"Young ladies should take care of themselves.Young ladies are delicate plants."	"austen"
"And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together."	"austen"
"I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be so irksome."	"austen"
"I must think your statement by no means fair."	"austen"
"I think he is just the person to do it, even without being in love."	"austen"
"We will not despair, however."	"austen"
"In Frank's last letter she complained, he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle's!"	"austen"
"Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there."	"austen"
"I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight."	"austen"
"I had no right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air."	"austen"
"This moment, if you please."	"austen"
"Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!"	"austen"
"This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them, sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hoursMrs."	"austen"
"I never heard of such a thing."	"austen"
"They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him."	"austen"
"The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least, which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent."	"austen"
"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public!"	"austen"
"Her face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned towards her aunt."	"austen"
"That is a great thing."	"austen"
"They seem to satisfy every body else."	"austen"
"Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will."	"austen"
"I am sure she is very goodI hope she will be very happy."	"austen"
"He sat by her at dinner."	"austen"
"That she was really ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it, at Randalls."	"austen"
"They were laying themselves open to that very phraseand to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another."	"austen"
"You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have many a time reproached me with doing."	"austen"
"That was your doing, papa."	"austen"
"She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played something else."	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish."	"austen"
"You are always with me."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion."	"austen"
"Ever since the dayabout four years agothat Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject."	"austen"
"My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on."	"austen"
"She had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush."	"austen"
"A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly."	"austen"
"Emma only nodded, and smiled.After a little thinking, and a very tender sigh, he added, Ah!"	"austen"
"Depend upon mebut ask no more questions."	"austen"
"The day approached, the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls before dinner, and every thing was safe."	"austen"
"Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and me on the other!Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!Beautiful lace!Now we all follow in her train."	"austen"
"We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain."	"austen"
"Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers."	"austen"
"I am sure I have not got one half so good."	"austen"
"Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but said only, coolly, I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls."	"austen"
"Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter, at least she thought so."	"austen"
"It used to stand here."	"austen"
"It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life of misery."	"austen"
"And no great harm if it does, said Mr. Woodhouse."	"austen"
"I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good."	"austen"
"Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest."	"austen"
"she cried.And such weather for exploring!These delays and disappointments are quite odious."	"austen"
"This was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of guessing."	"austen"
"Ours are all apple-tarts."	"austen"
"A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered, and surprizes be explained."	"austen"
"I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life."	"austen"
"No!she was more and more convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise."	"austen"
"I absolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.'"	"austen"
"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess."	"austen"
"NoI have never seen Mr. Elton, she replied, starting on this appeal; is heis he a tall man?"	"austen"
"She always travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution."	"austen"
"Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all, she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace would be fully secured.Marriage, in fact, would not do for her."	"austen"
"so considerate!But however, she is so far from well, that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure herand it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is unwell."	"austen"
"The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, Men never know when things are dirty or not; and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself, Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares."	"austen"
"You will be adored in Highbury."	"austen"
"She looked down the Randalls road."	"austen"
"Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings, Emma said, You are silent, Miss Fairfaxbut I hope you mean to take an interest in this news."	"austen"
"Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man; rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour."	"austen"
"His aunt could not bear to have him leave her."	"austen"
"It was a sad eventa great shockwith all her faults, what would Mr. Churchill do without her?"	"austen"
"and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something decisive."	"austen"
"This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties."	"austen"
"Emma had not to listen to such paradings againto any so exclusively addressed to herselfso disgustingly decorated with a dear Miss Woodhouse."	"austen"
"The Randalls party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most obliging invitation."	"austen"
"Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune."	"austen"
"We will not be parted."	"austen"
"Ah!Indeed I am very sorry.Come, shake hands with me."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten."	"austen"
"and A.Em-ma.Do you understand?"	"austen"
"Dining once with the Colesand having a ball talked of, which never took place."	"austen"
"What is it?why do you smile so?where did you hear it?at Randalls?"	"austen"
"You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me!"	"austen"
"Happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them."	"austen"
"It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently to Isabella."	"austen"
"My dear Harriet, what do you mean?"	"austen"
"These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick."	"austen"
"The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her."	"austen"
"She was the instigator."	"austen"
"She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing."	"austen"
"Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain."	"austen"
"What shall we do to rouse them?"	"austen"
"I must get rid of every thing.There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven!"	"austen"
"It was being very deficient."	"austen"
"The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist."	"austen"
"I am sure it almost killed me once."	"austen"
"The decree is issued by somebody."	"austen"
"We shall only be making each other more angry."	"austen"
"He called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own."	"austen"
"Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse's feelings were in sad warfare."	"austen"
"His professions and his proposals did him no service."	"austen"
"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing this invitation, was Emma's conclusion."	"austen"
"It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin."	"austen"
"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and would spurn any body's assistance."	"austen"
"Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross."	"austen"
"with the help of spectacles."	"austen"
"I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry with her as possible."	"austen"
"Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance.'"	"austen"
"But first of all, there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole."	"austen"
"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost enough to make me think so too."	"austen"
"and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things?"	"austen"
"Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency."	"austen"
"If you think he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe."	"austen"
"The Woodhouses were first in consequence there."	"austen"
"said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern.The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, Ah!"	"austen"
"Her ideas only varied as to the how much."	"austen"
"I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me, after yours."	"austen"
"She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each."	"austen"
"She touchedshe admittedshe acknowledged the whole truth."	"austen"
"After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began with I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr. Elton."	"austen"
"He writes like a sensible man, replied Emma, when she had read the letter."	"austen"
"He pausedand growing cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness, If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself."	"austen"
"He sat a little while in doubt."	"austen"
"Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends again."	"austen"
"CHAPTER VIII Harriet slept at Hartfield that night."	"austen"
"said Mr. Weston, looking about."	"austen"
"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion."	"austen"
"Delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thingand Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumphand she positively refused to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow's post.How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing to Emma.She did look vexed, she did speak pointedlyand at last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.Should not they walk?"	"austen"
"I have not been working uninterruptedly, he replied, I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily, it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe."	"austen"
"In a few minutes the carriage returned.Somebody talked of rain.I will see that there are umbrellas, sir, said Frank to his father: Miss Bates must not be forgotten: and away he went."	"austen"
"To complete every other recommendation, he had almost told her that he loved her."	"austen"
"It was the end of an old pencil,the part without any lead."	"austen"
"A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first mentioned in Highbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant, highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame of her merits, there was very little more for him to do, than to tell her Christian name, and say whose music she principally played."	"austen"
"Oh no;and it is but a short letter too."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton and I are very good friends, and nothing more; and she walked on, amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and in want of counsel."	"austen"
"Dear me!How should I ever have borne it!"	"austen"
"Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?that you have never thought seriously of her?"	"austen"
"I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome."	"austen"
"The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck."	"austen"
"A very proper compliment!and then follows the application, which I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending."	"austen"
"He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any body else."	"austen"
"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?"	"austen"
"I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve."	"austen"
"and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score."	"austen"
"She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father.She even wept over the idea of it, as a sin of thought."	"austen"
"The answer was only in this short note: Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any exercise."	"austen"
"You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here."	"austen"
"God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.But you understand me.Yes, you see, you understand my feelingsand will return them if you can."	"austen"
"To suffer her to engage herselfto suffer her even to think of such a measure!"	"austen"
"As a friend!repeated Mr. Knightley.Emma, that I fear is a wordNo, I have no wishStay, yes, why should I hesitate?I have gone too far already for concealment.Emma, I accept your offerExtraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as a friend.Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?"	"austen"
"This made a difficulty."	"austen"
"said she, with a conscious look."	"austen"
"she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton."	"austen"
"How very comfortable they make it;impossible to feel cold with such precautions."	"austen"
"CHAPTER IV A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down and hesitating, thus began: Miss Woodhouseif you are at leisureI have something that I should like to tell youa sort of confession to makeand then, you know, it will be over."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him."	"austen"
"Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when she might not bear to see herself."	"austen"
"I shall be happier to burn it, replied Harriet."	"austen"
"At last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel."	"austen"
"Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his."	"austen"
"And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.She felt that she had been risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds."	"austen"
"The most unaccountable business!"	"austen"
"They seem not able to do any thing without him."	"austen"
"She would be a loser in every way."	"austen"
"The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away."	"austen"
"He appears rough to you, said Emma, because you are so very gentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not think him rough."	"austen"
"The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was every thing, the other nothingand she sat musing on the difference of woman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed, till roused by Miss Bates's saying, Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte."	"austen"
"If attention, in future, could do away the past, she might hope to be forgiven."	"austen"
"All the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly smooth."	"austen"
"I am sure I do not know who is not."	"austen"
"He had time only to say, No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls, when the door was thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room."	"austen"
"Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable."	"austen"
"The danger would have been of my wearying you."	"austen"
"just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for."	"austen"
"Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends."	"austen"
"He sat musing a little while, and then said, But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon, though he does."	"austen"
"I was a kinder friend than you deserved."	"austen"
"A likeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital."	"austen"
"I was going to observe, sir, said Frank Churchill, that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body's catching coldso much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls!"	"austen"
"Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable."	"austen"
"The first error and the worst lay at her door."	"austen"
"A young woman, if she fall into bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young man's being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if he likes it."	"austen"
"Here is my sketch of the fourth, who was a baby."	"austen"
"sirbut a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected."	"austen"
"What a horrible idea!"	"austen"
"It does not bear talking of."	"austen"
"She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to place himself elsewhere."	"austen"
"No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she lovedand the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers."	"austen"
"She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to her."	"austen"
"Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeksindescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his attentions, his liveliness, his manners!"	"austen"
"To be sure, the charade, with its ready witbut then the soft eyesin fact it suited neither; it was a jumble without taste or truth."	"austen"
"Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their opinions the same."	"austen"
"If you want any farther explanation, continued he, smiling, they are paid for it."	"austen"
"They were never tolerated at Maple Grove."	"austen"
"How will a conundrum reckon?"	"austen"
"CHAPTER XIII Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love."	"austen"
"What she was, must be uncertain; but who she was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet's superior."	"austen"
"Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation ofand it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting him to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.Mr."	"austen"
"Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child, and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and found to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a very particular way indeed, that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious."	"austen"
"For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded and demure, Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did."	"austen"
"You have, I believe, and know the whole."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain."	"austen"
"'Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?"	"austen"
"You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes."	"austen"
"The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words."	"austen"
"I could not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least."	"austen"
"A superior performer!very far from it, I assure you."	"austen"
"You seem shut out from every thingin the most complete retirement.And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion."	"austen"
"Jane and I quite ready."	"austen"
"I do not care for myself."	"austen"
"It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof."	"austen"
"This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable; but it should have lasted longer."	"austen"
"But still, you will be an old maid!"	"austen"
"I shall leave you together."	"austen"
"Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass."	"austen"
"Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to be collected."	"austen"
"Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to."	"austen"
"Whoever might be her parents, said Mr. Knightley, whoever may have had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society."	"austen"
"She watched him well."	"austen"
"She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself."	"austen"
"But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her."	"austen"
"A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her."	"austen"
"Aye, that may suit your humble ideas of yourself;I know what a modest creature you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of life."	"austen"
"She thinks herself wrong, then, for having consented to a private engagement?"	"austen"
"Very welland as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma, that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way."	"austen"
"You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a situation together, said Jane, they are pretty sure to be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me."	"austen"
"And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour."	"austen"
"Understanding and gratification came together."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?"	"austen"
"Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax."	"austen"
"Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said."	"austen"
"Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book."	"austen"
"Observe the turn of her throat."	"austen"
"Let us make the best of itand, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour."	"austen"
"Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first."	"austen"
"My dear, dear anxious friend,said she, in mental soliloquy, while walking downstairs from her own room, always overcareful for every body's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure that all is right."	"austen"
"And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!Quite delightful; so many friends!"	"austen"
"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are unjust to Harriet."	"austen"
"An excellent charade indeed!"	"austen"
"My dear Emma, I am longing to talk to you."	"austen"
"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm."	"austen"
"I always regret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot be more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it, provided you are satisfied."	"austen"
"Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable."	"austen"
"James could take the note."	"austen"
"You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid to her."	"austen"
"Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her father's footsteps."	"austen"
"You are extremely kind, said Jane; but I cannot give up my early walk."	"austen"
"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly."	"austen"
"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy, said Mr. Knightley presently, though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet."	"austen"
"I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man: I feel sure that he is not."	"austen"
"Frank's mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her."	"austen"
"Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace."	"austen"
"Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods, We can finish this some other time, you know."	"austen"
"He wished the road might be impassable, that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body, calling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house."	"austen"
"Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?Who but herself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible, and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?If Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too."	"austen"
"Consider from how partial a quarter your information came."	"austen"
"She was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated."	"austen"
"Selina has entirely given up musicnever touches the instrumentthough she played sweetly."	"austen"
"Emma could not but feel all this; and then, her faceher featuresthere was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty."	"austen"
"cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the roomis not this the oddest news that ever was?"	"austen"
"He has encouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over this charade."	"austen"
"She never stopt till she had gone through the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposedand he had suffered, and was very sorryand he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever."	"austen"
"No, no,he gravely replied.Don't ask me."	"austen"
"Now I cannot say, that I think you are any of you looking well at present."	"austen"
"Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family."	"austen"
"She has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she begins to want change."	"austen"
"But this does not acquit him, Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame."	"austen"
"And Jane declaresWell!"	"austen"
"I wish I may not sink into 'poor Emma' with him at once.His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther."	"austen"
"But, my dear sir, cried Mr. Weston, if Emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party."	"austen"
"Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama?"	"austen"
")for presently she came forwardcame quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands, if I would."	"austen"
"My mother is delightfully well; and Jane caught no cold last night."	"austen"
"If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a very shameful and degrading connexion."	"austen"
"Her fatherand Harriet."	"austen"
"I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind; but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you."	"austen"
"Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demeritssome concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice by Harriet(there would be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightleybut justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent kindness.For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintainedor to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves."	"austen"
"When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed."	"austen"
"I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin."	"austen"
"There are secrets in all families, you know)The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off."	"austen"
"And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turnsmy winter walk."	"austen"
"I do not by any means engage for its being returned."	"austen"
"This was her history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that she had not done it."	"austen"
"That is the key to a great deal of capacity."	"austen"
"She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort."	"austen"
"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully, said Mr. Woodhouse; and always did."	"austen"
"How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his life!"	"austen"
"It was not the gipsiesit was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant."	"austen"
"They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival."	"austen"
"How she could have been so deceived!He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harrietnever!"	"austen"
"Emma shall be an angel, and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella."	"austen"
"I did, replied Emma, and they cannot forgive me."	"austen"
"my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use to any body."	"austen"
"But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse dancedfor doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfaxand even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wicked aids of vanityto assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to holdand then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest."	"austen"
"This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not being thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship were declining."	"austen"
"There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner."	"austen"
"It was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his father's assistance."	"austen"
"And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is thirteen."	"austen"
"I answered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, andmay I add?too cheerful in my views to be captious.We removed to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters all returned!and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I would forward them after that period to her at: in short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face."	"austen"
"noI am grieved to findI was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better, by no means better, rather worse."	"austen"
"When the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I trust, till we may carry her northward.But now, I am at such a distance from heris not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?Till this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation."	"austen"
"When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind."	"austen"
"Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence of any body equal to him in person or goodnessand did, in truth, prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited, that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force."	"austen"
"She was warmly gratifiedand in another moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part.He took her hand;whether she had not herself made the first motion, she could not sayshe might, perhaps, have rather offered itbut he took her hand, pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lipswhen, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go.Why he should feel such a scruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but done, she could not perceive.He would have judged better, she thought, if he had not stopped.The intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.It was with him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction."	"austen"
"Her parting look was gratefuland her parting words, Oh!"	"austen"
"then, don't speak it, don't speak it, she eagerly cried."	"austen"
"It struck her with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world."	"austen"
"Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to befor we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.I shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation."	"austen"
"Yesa good deal nearer."	"austen"
"His father only called him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and making no other comment than that all young people would have their little whims."	"austen"
"His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again."	"austen"
"It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.What two letters of the alphabet are there, that express perfection?"	"austen"
"They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own."	"austen"
"Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me."	"austen"
"CHAPTER VI The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again."	"austen"
"I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain."	"austen"
"She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict."	"austen"
"He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before."	"austen"
"Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last."	"austen"
"I think, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little."	"austen"
"by the bye, then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the momentI hope Mr. Knightley is well?"	"austen"
"He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole."	"austen"
"Pray come in; do come in."	"austen"
"certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall."	"austen"
"And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank and Emma."	"austen"
"Skilful has been the hand!"	"austen"
"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken."	"austen"
"I am not in want of that sort of compassion."	"austen"
"I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have."	"austen"
"Nopray let her have time to look about her."	"austen"
"A boyish scheme, indeed!I cannot comprehend a man's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument's coming if she could."	"austen"
"She hardly wished to have more leisure for them."	"austen"
"And he, the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to, quite like Mr. Knightley!"	"austen"
"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit."	"austen"
"And for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel."	"austen"
"Little things do not irritate him."	"austen"
"She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away."	"austen"
"To those who had no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quite independent."	"austen"
"do you recommend this side?Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchillonly it seems too goodbut just as you please."	"austen"
"Of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually are."	"austen"
"These were charming feelingsbut not lasting."	"austen"
"There was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its destined place with credit to them botha standing memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promising attachment was likely to add."	"austen"
"There he had not always the patience that could have been wished."	"austen"
"Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath wasMrs."	"austen"
"She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved."	"austen"
"The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it."	"austen"
"such delightful proofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over."	"austen"
"'How could he contrive to come?"	"austen"
"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we think differently."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley, said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confusedI am in a very extraordinary situation."	"austen"
"How do you all do?Quite well, I am much obliged to you."	"austen"
"What do you think of him?"	"austen"
"She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!"	"austen"
"If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all."	"austen"
"Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills, as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain."	"austen"
"So Emma thought, at least."	"austen"
"Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected."	"austen"
"She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about."	"austen"
"But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again, so near as town."	"austen"
"Might not the evening end in a dance?"	"austen"
"The interest he takes in herhis anxiety about her healthhis concern that she should have no happier prospect!"	"austen"
"Well, my dear, he deliberately began, considering we never saw her before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you."	"austen"
"One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules: she is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her."	"austen"
"In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her."	"austen"
"Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of."	"austen"
"But it is his gratitude on Harriet's account."	"austen"
"In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer."	"austen"
"No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery."	"austen"
"He had been thinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his persuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father's comfort, perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded."	"austen"
"The symptoms were favourable.Instead of answering, Harriet turned away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without regard."	"austen"
"no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and amused to think how little information I obtained."	"austen"
"The young man's conduct, and his sister's, seemed the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them."	"austen"
"Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things, and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment."	"austen"
"Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa, when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see togetherFrank Churchill, with Harriet leaning on his armactually Harriet!A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened."	"austen"
"Let us forgive each other at once."	"austen"
"Was not she like a daughter, his eldest daughter?he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately afterwards."	"austen"
"'I will not say, that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart."	"austen"
"Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell, and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still listen to Mrs. Cole."	"austen"
"If she had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to wonder that he, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken hers."	"austen"
"''I can see nobody,' said she; and up she got, and would go away; and that was what made us keep you waitingand extremely sorry and ashamed we were."	"austen"
"but those two lines are The best of all."	"austen"
"'But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me."	"austen"
"No, said he, smiling, that is no subject of regret at all."	"austen"
"This would be a trial."	"austen"
"And mine, said Mr. Knightley warmly, is, that if he turn out any thing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing!"	"austen"
"Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me."	"austen"
"Emma listened with the warmest concern; grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful."	"austen"
"It was a concern which brought just employment enough."	"austen"
"noI never conceived you could become indifferent."	"austen"
"Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her life."	"austen"
"no, nocried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she couldUpon no account in the world."	"austen"
"I hope it is a dry situation, and that her health will be taken good care of."	"austen"
"Yes, said Jane, we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing."	"austen"
"no, no;every feeling revolts."	"austen"
"In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again."	"austen"
"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance."	"austen"
"It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them."	"austen"
"She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece."	"austen"
"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your own master."	"austen"
"I have no doubt of it."	"austen"
"If Jane repressed her for a little time, she soon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side, there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects: The post-officecatching coldfetching lettersand friendship, were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant to Janeinquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton's meditated activity."	"austen"
"It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were accomplished."	"austen"
"Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself."	"austen"
"He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-roomhated sitting longwas always the first to move when he couldthat his father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over parish businessthat as long as he had staid, however, it had been pleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogetherthought it so abundant in agreeable familiesthat Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much."	"austen"
"Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley."	"austen"
"it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith's."	"austen"
"How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?"	"austen"
"That fellow, said he, indignantly, thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice."	"austen"
"Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a very strong proof."	"austen"
"But in time they will."	"austen"
"The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will."	"austen"
"It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing."	"austen"
"An old married manquite good for nothing."	"austen"
"I cannot recollect.It is very odd, but I cannot recollect.Mr."	"austen"
"Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own."	"austen"
"The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's faithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o'clock, that she was to think of her at four."	"austen"
"No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural talent forthinks strongly and clearlyand when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally find proper words."	"austen"
"Harriet looked grave."	"austen"
"Pray, Emma, said he, may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax?"	"austen"
"No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to-day on that very account.Such a dreadful broiling morning!I went over the fields too(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made it so much the worse."	"austen"
"What say you both to our collecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?It must be the same party, you know, quite the same party, not one exception."	"austen"
"She frequently gave me hints of it."	"austen"
"Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I must be off immediately."	"austen"
"Perfection should not have come quite so soon."	"austen"
"and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you feltI could only be certain that there was a preferenceand a preference which I never believed him to deserve.He is a disgrace to the name of man.And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature."	"austen"
"I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else."	"austen"
"I shall not discuss it here."	"austen"
"There is no use in delay."	"austen"
"CHAPTER XIX If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty."	"austen"
"There was a little blush, and then this answer, I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters."	"austen"
"dear, Miss Woodhousewell, at last, I fancy, he looked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they began whispering to one another."	"austen"
"He re-urgedshe re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the paper from the table, she returned it Oh!"	"austen"
"He sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his treesI believe there is two of them."	"austen"
"You had it from himself, had you?"	"austen"
"He was afraid they should have a very bad drive."	"austen"
"He did not think we ever walked this road."	"austen"
"Elton, before she could be spoken to, was ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying Must I go first?"	"austen"
"Miss Taylor, if you had not married, you would have staid at home with me."	"austen"
"Excellent dancing indeed!Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me.I set off without saying a word, just as I told you."	"austen"
"She had hoped for an answer herefor a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as she could judge, deep in thought."	"austen"
"Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech."	"austen"
"We cannot suppose, said Emma, smiling, that Mr. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in Highbury; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned, in consideration of the motive."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade."	"austen"
"The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a distance from."	"austen"
"How little did I think!The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me look too, which was very good-natured."	"austen"
"My poor dear Harriet!"	"austen"
"On their first coming into the country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of meansthe house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them."	"austen"
"She listened, and found it well worth listening to."	"austen"
"She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though growing very like her;she spoke some of her feelings, by observing audibly to her partner, Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!Very good-natured, I declare."	"austen"
"Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject."	"austen"
"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening."	"austen"
"Ayelike Maple Grove, I dare say."	"austen"
"To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought."	"austen"
"Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or that she admired him?"	"austen"
"Mr. Elton in love with me!What an idea!"	"austen"
"Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew uncomfortable."	"austen"
"It has been completely unexpected."	"austen"
"The gentlemen spoke of his horse."	"austen"
"She would rather busy herself about any thing than speak."	"austen"
"She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston."	"austen"
"Somebody had placed her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder."	"austen"
"He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure."	"austen"
"I will move a little farther off."	"austen"
"He had just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly."	"austen"
"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much."	"austen"
"Proportions, fore-shortening.Oh no!"	"austen"
"She was in gay spirits, and would have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet hers."	"austen"
"I hope you will be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy."	"austen"
"'The consequence,' said she, 'has been a state of perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought."	"austen"
"I think their father is too rough with them very often."	"austen"
"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than what you mention."	"austen"
"Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort."	"austen"
"These matters are always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them."	"austen"
"Frank Churchill sang again."	"austen"
"He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of: for I cannot depend upon his coming."	"austen"
"convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield."	"austen"
"Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand."	"austen"
"Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy."	"austen"
"No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it very sickly except Ah!"	"austen"
"Emma was extremely confused."	"austen"
"He was quite delighted."	"austen"
"But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane."	"austen"
"Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that her husband could write a good letter."	"austen"
"I do admire your patriotism."	"austen"
"the good BatesesI am quite ashamed of myselfbut you mention them in most of your letters."	"austen"
"no; cautious as a minister of state."	"austen"
"He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty, or with ten."	"austen"
"Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton."	"austen"
"Besides, she is out of health now; but that indeed, by her own account, she has always been."	"austen"
"She wanted to be alone."	"austen"
"You are prepared for the worst, I seeand very bad it is."	"austen"
"She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion."	"austen"
"Now, said Harriet, you must recollect."	"austen"
"No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present."	"austen"
"Emma returned all her attention to her father, saying in secret I am glad I have done being in love with him."	"austen"
"The like reserve prevailed on other topics."	"austen"
"He may be sure of every woman's approbation while he writes with such gallantry."	"austen"
"You are trying not to smile."	"austen"
"But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John."	"austen"
"Oh, the difference of situation and habit!"	"austen"
"He is as well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet's."	"austen"
"They would be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe."	"austen"
"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with him."	"austen"
"It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast."	"austen"
"There was no getting at her real opinion."	"austen"
"Ladies and gentlemenI am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires something very entertaining from each of you, in a general way."	"austen"
"It could not be otherwise."	"austen"
"I am afraid Jane is not very well, said she, but I do not know; they tell me she is well."	"austen"
"And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour."	"austen"
"I am sure they were talking of me; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me(do you think he was, Miss Woodhouse?"	"austen"
"Do you really think it a bad thing?why so?"	"austen"
"The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself."	"austen"
"She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied."	"austen"
"those dear little children."	"austen"
"I doubt its being very clever myself, said Mr. Weston."	"austen"
"For my temptation to think it a right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, and casements above, in Highbury."	"austen"
"He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety."	"austen"
"She is still nearer.And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body."	"austen"
"There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve."	"austen"
"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a great difference in your way of life."	"austen"
"One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry."	"austen"
"Being my friend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it."	"austen"
"She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feel afraid."	"austen"
"I have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be seen."	"austen"
"When once it had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim."	"austen"
"Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted."	"austen"
"In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.Mrs."	"austen"
"With the greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.In order to assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible objectbut I am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my wish.She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me."	"austen"
"Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed."	"austen"
"Quite seasonable; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence."	"austen"
"I will take it home with me at night."	"austen"
"They burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or messageand it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined him to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long."	"austen"
"From Frank Churchill's face, where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy with her shawl."	"austen"
"Be satisfied, said he, I will not raise any outcry."	"austen"
"The How d'ye do's were quiet and constrained on each side."	"austen"
"She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's conversation, but she found her altogether very engagingnot inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talkand yet so far from pushing, shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement."	"austen"
"For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me.Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.What was to be done?One thing only.I must speak to my uncle."	"austen"
"I really could not help exclaiming!"	"austen"
"Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively."	"austen"
"Any other situation would have been much less in character."	"austen"
"Ma'am, addressing her, do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane's handwriting?"	"austen"
"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time, said Mr. Knightley, laughing, and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better thing."	"austen"
"There was deep consciousness about him, and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend's."	"austen"
"I believe I have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a wayso very odd a waythat I cannot keep my eyes from her."	"austen"
"She must not appear to think it a misfortune.With all the spirits she could command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be obtainedwhich, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of allshe and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person's company whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world."	"austen"
"Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.I spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man!"	"austen"
"There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before Mr. Elton and his bride was in every body's mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten."	"austen"
"I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want it;afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself."	"austen"
"I think you understand me, therefore."	"austen"
"He does not care about Jane Fairfax."	"austen"
"Pray excuse me; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself."	"austen"
"Little Henry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say."	"austen"
"Somebody else believed Mrs. Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked."	"austen"
"And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there."	"austen"
"I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir."	"austen"
"At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed, Ha!"	"austen"
"their luxury and ease."	"austen"
"If we set the example, many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations."	"austen"
"This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being at least very near it, and saved only by her own indifference(for still her resolution held of never marrying)the honour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance."	"austen"
"You will not like staying late."	"austen"
"Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to improve as he could."	"austen"
"It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence."	"austen"
"This is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure!"	"austen"
"I mention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!"	"austen"
"They might be more safely held up as a pattern."	"austen"
"Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard's unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton's would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much."	"austen"
"so charming as you are!"	"austen"
"Pardon mebut you will be limited as to numberonly three at once."	"austen"
"Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!But of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance."	"austen"
"She could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approvesomething of ingratitude, merely glossed overit must be done, or what would become of Harriet?"	"austen"
"The most indefatigable, true friend."	"austen"
"I assure you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more than I can express."	"austen"
"She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr. Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr. Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me."	"austen"
"It was no longer in Emma's power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures."	"austen"
"Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father."	"austen"
"interrupted Emma, there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston might be his son's superior.In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancing than by any thing else.There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,not classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,so young as he looked!He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had placed himself."	"austen"
"But I thought he would have staid now, and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to the room,) I have not been able to succeed."	"austen"
"As to her illness, all nothing of course."	"austen"
"I cannot let you continue in your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.But I never have."	"austen"
"He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms."	"austen"
"Things must come to a crisis soon now."	"austen"
"Instances have been known of young people passing many, many months successively, without being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue either to body or mind;but when a beginning is madewhen the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, feltit must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more."	"austen"
"It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish, she continued, to have no reserves with you on this subject."	"austen"
"Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home."	"austen"
"Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished."	"austen"
"She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man, for she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not invent illnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message."	"austen"
"Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will oblige us."	"austen"
"Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing, that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave."	"austen"
"John, the second, is named after his father."	"austen"
"said Emma, as she turned back into the hall again."	"austen"
"It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature."	"austen"
"It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well."	"austen"
"I know he had horses to-dayfor we arrived together; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that could betray."	"austen"
"it is no difficulty to see who you take after!"	"austen"
"Dear me!it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!"	"austen"
"With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least, there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approachnew carriage, bell-ringing, and all."	"austen"
"The shame, he answered, is all mine, or ought to be."	"austen"
"Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well know."	"austen"
"said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss Fairfax's eye."	"austen"
"John Knightley looked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said, I could not have believed it even of him."	"austen"
"I was wrong, he continued, in talking of its being broke to you."	"austen"
"I never met with a disposition more truly amiable."	"austen"
"And yet it was far, very far, from impossible.Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers?"	"austen"
"Miss Bates should never againno, never!"	"austen"
"Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you."	"austen"
"The loss of the ballthe loss of the young manand all that the young man might be feeling!It was too wretched!Such a delightful evening as it would have been!Every body so happy!"	"austen"
"I think him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and approveso truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism."	"austen"
"He agreed to it, but with so quiet a Yes, as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it."	"austen"
"You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon."	"austen"
"It was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square;and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing any body again."	"austen"
"He had caught both substance and shadowboth fortune and affection, and was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and his own concernsexpecting to be congratulatedready to be laughed atand, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more cautiously gallant."	"austen"
"The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort."	"austen"
"I am very little ableHave you a chair, ma'am?"	"austen"
"Emma could not resist."	"austen"
"And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was very well married, to a gentleman in a great way, near Bristol, who kept two carriages!"	"austen"
"After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him."	"austen"
"Break it to me, cried Emma, standing still with terror.Good God!Mr."	"austen"
"Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend."	"austen"
"When she became sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings."	"austen"
"(with a little sigh of sentiment)."	"austen"
"I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her."	"austen"
"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear, said her father."	"austen"
"cried Emma, after a moment's pauseWhat do you mean?Good Heaven!"	"austen"
"You could make it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?"	"austen"
"I should not have used the expression."	"austen"
"And as to conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know."	"austen"
"Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state."	"austen"
"Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her."	"austen"
"He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging."	"austen"
"Knightley;' and, from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.And yet it is formal."	"austen"
"Cannot you, my dear Emmacannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear?"	"austen"
"She suspected that it had; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had not been in vain."	"austen"
"But the case is altered now."	"austen"
"You left nothing undone."	"austen"
"In the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings' coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill, whose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it."	"austen"
"Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body."	"austen"
"Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper."	"austen"
"In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important."	"austen"
"There must be ample room in it for every real comfort."	"austen"
"'which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed at."	"austen"
"He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself, she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton."	"austen"
"A real injury to the childrena most mortifying change, and material loss to them all;a very great deduction from her father's daily comfortand, as to herself, she could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey."	"austen"
"Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly, warm-hearted woman."	"austen"
"Very happy to hear it."	"austen"
"Have you indeed, sir?Bless me!"	"austen"
"The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and when he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict, that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride."	"austen"
"It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it."	"austen"
"I shall have no fears for you with him."	"austen"
"But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton, than it was removed."	"austen"
"There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her glance."	"austen"
"The party did not break up without Emma's being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, He has asked her, my dear."	"austen"
"He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful."	"austen"
"That was what happened before tea."	"austen"
"We have been calling at Randalls, said she, and found them both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be."	"austen"
"The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have her carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure."	"austen"
"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me."	"austen"
"A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or neither."	"austen"
"His ideas seemed more moderatehis feelings warmer."	"austen"
"This was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which she reached; and without being long in reaching it.She was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to herher affection for Mr. Knightley.Every other part of her mind was disgusting."	"austen"
"Woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now; or with no important variation."	"austen"
"She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which silenced, Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"She would not be in a hurry to find fault, but she suspected that there was no elegance;ease, but not elegance."	"austen"
"Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse."	"austen"
"He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression of his eyes overpowered her."	"austen"
"Do not forget your engagement."	"austen"
"He would feel himself in the right; and the declarationmade, of course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper mannerwould do him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do."	"austen"
"Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete."	"austen"
"I could almost assert that you had named Mr. Frank Churchill."	"austen"
"They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention."	"austen"
"It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley."	"austen"
"As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appearbut no, she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners."	"austen"
"Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston."	"austen"
"Indeed!that must be a very great pleasure."	"austen"
"She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse: This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir."	"austen"
"When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few secondsand the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it would yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and leave her less to regret when it were gone."	"austen"
"It did her no service however."	"austen"
"He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken; he asked my pardon and said no more."	"austen"
"Let no name ever pass our lips."	"austen"
"Woodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by him, stirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him, that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need."	"austen"
"He is to be in town next week, if not sooner."	"austen"
"Miss Fairfax, I dare say, would not have me if I were to ask herand I am very sure I shall never ask her."	"austen"
"Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account."	"austen"
"Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was dueor rather what would be kind by me."	"austen"
"At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the other had been the person; and nowit is possible She paused a few moments."	"austen"
"You will see her to advantage; see her and hear herno, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue."	"austen"
"Did you ever hear of that?A water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard."	"austen"
"You only mean, that he intends it."	"austen"
"Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.Her days of insignificance and evil were over.She would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted."	"austen"
"Worse than I had supposed."	"austen"
"This was the amount of the whole story,of his communication and of Harriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.He dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself."	"austen"
"He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence."	"austen"
"I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player, without exception, in England."	"austen"
"She was a beautiful creature when she came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature."	"austen"
"How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she could not tell."	"austen"
"Emma could not bear to give him pain."	"austen"
"William did not seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master's profit than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent away."	"austen"
"Knightley marry!No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt it now."	"austen"
"Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs. Weston's to receive them."	"austen"
"Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath, was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to convey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk and the direction, was consequently a blank."	"austen"
"Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to hear it."	"austen"
"The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her thoughts.She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours."	"austen"
"If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it."	"austen"
"Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they might resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer."	"austen"
"It was better to pay my visit, then He hesitated, got up, walked to a window."	"austen"
"The acquaintance at present had no charm for her."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle."	"austen"
"The confession completely renewed her first shameand the sight of Harriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again."	"austen"
"My dear Emma, said he, moving from his chair into one close by her, you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant evening."	"austen"
"In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young manone who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smilesMr."	"austen"
"Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone."	"austen"
"I saw you first in February."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together."	"austen"
"She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself."	"austen"
"It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful."	"austen"
"Miss Woodhouse, must you be going?You seem but just comeso very obliging of you."	"austen"
"She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, I did not know that proper names were allowed, pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered."	"austen"
"My dear, you are too particular, said her husband."	"austen"
"There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer."	"austen"
"He praised her for being without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt on them to her more than once.Much that lived in Harriet's memory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected, by Emma."	"austen"
"His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment."	"austen"
"No, we should not have heard, if it had not been for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon."	"austen"
"Depend upon it, we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon."	"austen"
"A variety of evils crossed his mind."	"austen"
"I think seriously of Miss Smith!Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled."	"austen"
"It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining any influence to alarm."	"austen"
"so long ago as the 7th of November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since."	"austen"
"You cannot mean that he has even proposed to her againyet."	"austen"
"I shall never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very windy day last Easterand ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night, on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor."	"austen"
"A man cannot be more so, was his short, full answer."	"austen"
"Don't say I was cross."	"austen"
"had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear."	"austen"
"Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance."	"austen"
"Not a creature knowing it but themselvesneither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.It is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almost incredible to myself."	"austen"
"She and Mr. Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time."	"austen"
"In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off."	"austen"
"It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither master nor mistress was at home; they had both been out some time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield."	"austen"
"You had better explore to Donwell, replied Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"You think her diffident."	"austen"
"It was quite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent."	"austen"
"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!"	"austen"
"The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house."	"austen"
"you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate."	"austen"
"It is as long again as almost all we have had before."	"austen"
"The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixingand Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other."	"austen"
"She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy."	"austen"
"We were very wrong before; we will be cautious now.He is your superior, no doubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have been matches of greater disparity."	"austen"
"I like him very well."	"austen"
"The information was, as you state, that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins."	"austen"
"Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there."	"austen"
"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly."	"austen"
"And it is not merely the housethe grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like."	"austen"
"It was a delightful visit;perfect, in being much too short."	"austen"
"Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in spite of the very natural wish of a little change."	"austen"
"And he was really a very pleasing young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like."	"austen"
"(looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on every body's assent)Do not you all think I shall?"	"austen"
"It cannot be long, I think, before she comes."	"austen"
"She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days."	"austen"
"You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest."	"austen"
"He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of the day."	"austen"
"It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand."	"austen"
"He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself: I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way."	"austen"
"I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad."	"austen"
"I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey."	"austen"
"Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence."	"austen"
"Oh yes, sir, cried she with ready sympathy, how you must miss her!"	"austen"
"At first, she thought it was a good deal; and afterwards, but little."	"austen"
"The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole."	"austen"
"Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?"	"austen"
"In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior partyin which her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true styleand more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order."	"austen"
"Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters."	"austen"
"Jane she had a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, Well, my dear, I shall say you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough."	"austen"
"Harriet is disgraced by any comparison."	"austen"
"When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite."	"austen"
"But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half Emma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley cannot stop."	"austen"
"cried Mr. John Knightley, hearing his own name."	"austen"
"Her tears fell abundantlybut her grief was so truly artless, that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyesand she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understandingreally for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the twoand that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do."	"austen"
"By his style, I should imagine it just settled."	"austen"
"And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman whom no one named without good-will."	"austen"
"I am sure I had much rather hear you."	"austen"
"We had better move on, Mr. Weston, said she, we are detaining the girls."	"austen"
"It ought to be no recommendation to you."	"austen"
"It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been."	"austen"
"Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can."	"austen"
"She was his object, and every body must perceive it."	"austen"
"A man who had been in motion since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been still, who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had been in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!Such a man, to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside, and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world!Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party."	"austen"
"Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan."	"austen"
"Something that would do!"	"austen"
"One can see that she feels the want of encouragement."	"austen"
"Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness to be pleased with other people."	"austen"
"You must get his consent before you ask mine."	"austen"
"Mr. Perry did say so."	"austen"
"Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being preparedand her eyes, in eager gaze, said, No, this is impossible!"	"austen"
"I see what a life I am to lead among you."	"austen"
"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say 'poor Miss Taylor.'"	"austen"
"My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings, Lords of the earth!"	"austen"
"I wonder what will become of her!"	"austen"
"'If he would say so to her at once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no opposition made to his going."	"austen"
"I had no intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes, when I first entered the house."	"austen"
"I do not believe I did you any good."	"austen"
"He only means He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two, interrupted she, with a sort of serious smilemuch less, perhaps, than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject."	"austen"
"And how tired you must be after your journey!"	"austen"
"said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement."	"austen"
"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page."	"austen"
"Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet steady voice, How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!They will sometimes obtrudebut how you can court them!"	"austen"
"I should not mind walking half the way."	"austen"
"Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about her sister."	"austen"
"Every thing was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted."	"austen"
"For a little while Emma persevered in her silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say, I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse him."	"austen"
"No; not immediately here."	"austen"
"I think you play quite as well as she does."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she could be in love with more than three men in one year."	"austen"
"She was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look."	"austen"
"That very dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply."	"austen"
"You do not think I could mean you, or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean you."	"austen"
"But I gave what I believed the general opinion, when I called him plain."	"austen"
"I think Mr. John Knightley very far from looking well."	"austen"
"Always the first person to be thought of!"	"austen"
"They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere."	"austen"
"She had no objection."	"austen"
"Upon these occasions, a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer."	"austen"
"A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion."	"austen"
"These kind of things are very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer."	"austen"
"While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare say."	"austen"
"Ill, very illthat is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill."	"austen"
"After the first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began with, I have something to tell you, Emma; some news."	"austen"
"'My friend Knightley' had been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend."	"austen"
"Ambition, as well as love, had probably been mortified."	"austen"
"Exactly so, indeedquite unheard ofbut some ladies say any thing."	"austen"
"I was late; I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she would not suffer it."	"austen"
"my dear, human flesh!"	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body."	"austen"
"A little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her caro sposo, and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery."	"austen"
"How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!"	"austen"
"What you direct in this house cannot be wrong."	"austen"
"It is the greatest amusement in the world!"	"austen"
"He has a wife and family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time."	"austen"
"You are better placed here; very fit for a wife, but not at all for a governess."	"austen"
"And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising."	"austen"
"and to see you in such excellent looks!I would not have missed this meeting for the world."	"austen"
"He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it."	"austen"
"Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix."	"austen"
"He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance, Would not she give him her support?would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder had no infection?"	"austen"
"She is his principal correspondent, I assure you."	"austen"
"Sir, you are most kind."	"austen"
"This will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house."	"austen"
"She made her plan; she would speak of something totally differentthe children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying, You will not ask me what is the point of envy.You are determined, I see, to have no curiosity.You are wisebut I cannot be wise."	"austen"
"You may well be amazed, returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover You may well be amazed."	"austen"
"Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow."	"austen"
"Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines."	"austen"
"But I am a partial old friend."	"austen"
"Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter."	"austen"
"She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that in living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there would be much, very much, to be borne with."	"austen"
"Now I am secure of you for ever."	"austen"
"I shall certainly be at leisure."	"austen"
"It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire."	"austen"
"I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of things, occur to him."	"austen"
"With a faint blush, she presently replied, Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax."	"austen"
"and she and her partner the happiest!I said it would be so, was the only consolation."	"austen"
"I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever existed."	"austen"
"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear."	"austen"
"It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account, that gave the deepest hue to his offence.Poor Harriet!"	"austen"
"So unreasonably early!"	"austen"
"How angry and how diverted he would be!"	"austen"
"It would be almost beginning their life of civility again."	"austen"
"It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was peculiarly gratifying."	"austen"
"Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen her."	"austen"
"that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here."	"austen"
"Can you trust me with such flatterers?Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong?"	"austen"
"But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied."	"austen"
"thought Emma, he would have done as much for Harriet."	"austen"
"Such an extraordinary dream of mine!"	"austen"
"How very differently we feel!Not think they will do each other any good!"	"austen"
"really, never!Bless me!"	"austen"
"Well, well, means to make her an offer then."	"austen"
"My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion."	"austen"
"They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet's acquaintance: and besides, what was the value of Harriet's description?So easily pleasedso little discerning;what signified her praise?"	"austen"
"He had gone away deeply offendedhe came back engaged to anotherand to another as superior, of course, to the first, as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost."	"austen"
"Frank Churchill caught the name."	"austen"
"Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that is truly important."	"austen"
"Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps, replied Emma, smilingbut, excuse me, it must be thought of."	"austen"
"How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?Emma, I had not thought it possible."	"austen"
"I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly."	"austen"
"'Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune."	"austen"
"I do not pretend to Emma's genius for foretelling and guessing."	"austen"
"If I could but have kept longer away!"	"austen"
"no, there is but one."	"austen"
"Every thing as natural and simple as possible."	"austen"
"How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling declared him now to be?"	"austen"
"He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk, immediately fixed on Highbury.He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always chuse the same."	"austen"
"Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, he would make a good husband."	"austen"
"I would give any money for it."	"austen"
"He liked very much to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked."	"austen"
"You shall have a charming wife."	"austen"
"Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed."	"austen"
"My playing is no more like her's, than a lamp is like sunshine."	"austen"
"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they?"	"austen"
"Let us wait, therefore, for this letter."	"austen"
"I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself."	"austen"
"CHAPTER VIII Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's dinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any imperfection which could be concealed."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley and Harriet!It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it.There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony."	"austen"
"In the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him, while Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror, her naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's own account had been given, he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms."	"austen"
"If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish."	"austen"
"This was too true for contradiction."	"austen"
"She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction."	"austen"
"Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away."	"austen"
"It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs."	"austen"
"Most favourably for his nephewgave his consent with scarcely a difficulty."	"austen"
"Indeed I do you justice, my good friend."	"austen"
"There is my news:I thought it would interest you, said Mr. Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them."	"austen"
"He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father."	"austen"
"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer at farthest, continued Mrs. Elton; and that will be our time for exploring."	"austen"
"If he were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with himhad made such a point of it, that he had promised him conditionally to come."	"austen"
"regular features, open countenance, with a complexion!"	"austen"
"They continued together with unabated regard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!No longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their's!How was it to be endured?"	"austen"
"By the bye, that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece."	"austen"
"Do let me hear what she says.'"	"austen"
"And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of bothsuch being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind."	"austen"
"He was the brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great assistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable."	"austen"
"It was enough for her to feel."	"austen"
"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of?"	"austen"
"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence."	"austen"
"I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house tooknowing what I had been accustomed toof course he was not wholly without apprehension."	"austen"
"a fine complimentary opening: But it is his way."	"austen"
"I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade, replied Jane; governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies."	"austen"
"Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen."	"austen"
"And it always ended in Kitty, a fair but frozen maid."	"austen"
"Well, said she to herself, this is most strange!After I had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill behind!Most strange indeed!But there is, I believe, in many men, especially single men, such an inclinationsuch a passion for dining outa dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing gives way to itand this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked."	"austen"
"Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family!"	"austen"
"He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning to Emma, said, Here is something quite new to me."	"austen"
"Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence."	"austen"
"We seemed to understand each other."	"austen"
"Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs. Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth."	"austen"
"She plays charmingly."	"austen"
"John enters like a brother into my happiness, continued Mr. Knightley, but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise."	"austen"
"Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know, there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly."	"austen"
"I used to be quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention."	"austen"
"He was the son of Mr. Westonhe was continually hereI always found him very pleasantand, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at lastmy vanity was flattered, and I allowed his attentions."	"austen"
"They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance."	"austen"
"She heard of her walking with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons!"	"austen"
"What happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them!"	"austen"
"I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties."	"austen"
"Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking on the other."	"austen"
"I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world!"	"austen"
"Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from."	"austen"
"as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet."	"austen"
"cried Emma, putting her hand before her face, and jumping up, you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear."	"austen"
"Receive it on my judgment."	"austen"
"If it was not for the drawback of her illnessbut I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly."	"austen"
"She had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr. Weston's hint."	"austen"
"But what shall I say?"	"austen"
"The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete."	"austen"
"We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for what she goes to."	"austen"
"Harriet would have been a better match."	"austen"
"You order me, whether you speak or not."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.She had been extremely surprized, never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it long ago.How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield!"	"austen"
"Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place."	"austen"
"CHAPTER XII Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being first with Mr. Knightley, first in interest and affection.Satisfied that it was so, and feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had been.Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella."	"austen"
"To know that she thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy."	"austen"
"And he is a very clever boy, indeed."	"austen"
"I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by calling you Mr. K.But I will promise, she added presently, laughing and blushingI will promise to call you once by your Christian name."	"austen"
"she shall not do such a thing again, eagerly rejoined Mrs. Elton."	"austen"
"I treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse."	"austen"
"While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required."	"austen"
"Nobody, who has not been in the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be."	"austen"
"The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary, cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-dayand Mr. Elton was called on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse."	"austen"
"It made her animatedopen heartedshe voluntarily said; Oh!"	"austen"
"do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's sensations from you, or from any body else."	"austen"
"and Mrs. Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as yourself."	"austen"
"But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well."	"austen"
"This is a connexion which offers nothing but good."	"austen"
"She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations, which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the eagerness of Harriet's wondering questions."	"austen"
"Would Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends contrivedno travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had declined it!"	"austen"
"You will never go to Swisserland."	"austen"
"I was convinced there were two, and there is but one."	"austen"
"Why, pretty well; but not quite well."	"austen"
"We were too magnificent, said he."	"austen"
"No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's absenting himself."	"austen"
"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancingMiss Smith."	"austen"
"There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window."	"austen"
"Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should have ceased."	"austen"
"Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipatedwhich is the exact truth."	"austen"
"He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he wished to do it, it might be done."	"austen"
"Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers; but, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in."	"austen"
"Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my motherindeed I do not know who is notand she had mentioned it to her in confidence; she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of."	"austen"
"She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and Harriet's mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength."	"austen"
"No, my dear, said her father instantly; that I am sure you are not."	"austen"
"Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before."	"austen"
"Poor Jane Fairfax!thought Emma.You have not deserved this."	"austen"
"CHAPTER XVI It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting."	"austen"
"Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.But two such offers in one day!Never were such neighbours."	"austen"
"She was obliged to stop and think."	"austen"
"You may depend upon me, said she."	"austen"
"this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives, as my father informs me."	"austen"
"I am ready, if the others are."	"austen"
"And as for objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much, to care about."	"austen"
"Such kind friends, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning's party."	"austen"
"It is so, indeed, continued Mr. Knightley; I have it from Robert Martin himself."	"austen"
"How the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep!"	"austen"
"YesI imaginedthat isI did not He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report."	"austen"
"She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her."	"austen"
"One would rather have a stranger preferred than one's very particular friendwith a stranger it might not recur againbut the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!Poor Mrs. Dixon!"	"austen"
"When we talked about him, it was as clear as possible."	"austen"
"But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for."	"austen"
"Has he been here on this occasionor has he not?"	"austen"
"He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining, though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure; for she said, Nonsense!"	"austen"
"It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more!"	"austen"
"These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself."	"austen"
"Do you think I am right?"	"austen"
"I am sure there is nobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse's."	"austen"
"I see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown."	"austen"
"Mrs. Stokes,' said Ibut I had not time for more."	"austen"
"He joined them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them."	"austen"
"There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like."	"austen"
"She has been so kind as to promise it."	"austen"
"The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the first subject on meeting."	"austen"
"So far from having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views, till this moment."	"austen"
"made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already."	"austen"
"I only name possibilities."	"austen"
"She felt it at her heart."	"austen"
"It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her; she would waitand, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go."	"austen"
"Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself."	"austen"
"What I said just now, meant nothing."	"austen"
"Let me hear from you without delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars."	"austen"
"how could it be?Then I must have dreamt itbut I was completely persuadedMiss Smith, you walk as if you were tired."	"austen"
"Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations."	"austen"
"Waiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be nice."	"austen"
"Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling."	"austen"
"Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any bodyany body at allMrs."	"austen"
"These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself."	"austen"
"But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable; it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as her father's happinessin other words, his liferequired Hartfield to continue her home, it should be his likewise."	"austen"
"Ungrateful!What do you mean?"	"austen"
"A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery."	"austen"
"A very few days brought the party from London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfiedunaccountable as it was!that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley, and was now forming all her views of happiness."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge."	"austen"
"He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma."	"austen"
"I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made discoveries."	"austen"
"They all seemed to remember the day, the hour, the party, the occasionto feel the same consciousness, the same regretsto be ready to return to the same good understanding; and they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when the carriage reappeared, and all was over."	"austen"
"She felt for Harriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her brain."	"austen"
"she cried, satisfied to have no one preferred to herself.You are a humourist, and may say what you like."	"austen"
"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now."	"austen"
"She saw in a moment all the possible good."	"austen"
"A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a short struggle."	"austen"
"Wellif you please, said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, if you think she will be of any use."	"austen"
"Two months must bring it to the proof."	"austen"
"He understood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else."	"austen"
"I am afraid, returned Emma, sighing, that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy."	"austen"
"(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.)"	"austen"
"Their affection was always to subside into friendship."	"austen"
"Without scruplewithout apologywithout much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself her lover."	"austen"
"when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill, said Mr. Knightley dryly, writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will, of course, put forth his best."	"austen"
"No doubt it had been from jealousy.In Jane's eyes she had been a rival; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed."	"austen"
"We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax."	"austen"
"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, siror we should not have gone."	"austen"
"Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory; no rencontre, no alarm of the kind;and now it had happened to the very person, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!It certainly was very extraordinary!And knowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at this period, it struck her the more."	"austen"
"Have not I some right to complain?"	"austen"
"Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement."	"austen"
"It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty."	"austen"
"Had she intended ever to marry him, it might have been worth while to pause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference, and the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough."	"austen"
"Such was his own account at Randall's."	"austen"
"I am not like Jane; I wish I were."	"austen"
"They are not at all the less written you know, because you divide them."	"austen"
"Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others."	"austen"
"It is the garden of England, you know."	"austen"
"I am quite easy on that head, replied Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"Mr. Churchill had made a point of it, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted."	"austen"
"But (lowering her voice)nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people."	"austen"
"The weather added what it could of gloom."	"austen"
"It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of her life."	"austen"
"Nobody talked about it."	"austen"
"They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last."	"austen"
"Her curiosity was greatly excited."	"austen"
"For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received."	"austen"
"Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this."	"austen"
"Mrs. Goddard, what say you to half a glass of wine?"	"austen"
"Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than exceed by two."	"austen"
"It would be such a delight to have her picture!"	"austen"
"Mrs. Cole has servants to send."	"austen"
"There were not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer."	"austen"
"Emma was extremely glad to see himbut there was a degree of confusiona number of embarrassing recollections on each side."	"austen"
"She then took a longer time for consideration."	"austen"
"You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma."	"austen"
"The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary."	"austen"
"Referring the education to her seemed to imply it."	"austen"
"A man who felt rightly would say at once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill'Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but I must go and see my father immediately."	"austen"
"The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions."	"austen"
"she was not so easily to be talked out of it."	"austen"
"My charge would be much more concise than her's, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic them."	"austen"
"They should take care of their health and their complexion."	"austen"
"I am amused by one part of John's letterdid you notice it?where he says, that my information did not take him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind."	"austen"
"It is a sort of prologue to the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by matter-of-fact prose."	"austen"
"I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake ends where it does."	"austen"
"As you will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession."	"austen"
"And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies."	"austen"
"Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet's age, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance, without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them."	"austen"
"I always stand up for womenand I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's making incredible exertions to avoid it."	"austen"
"Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet's mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations."	"austen"
"Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;Mr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door."	"austen"
"He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at Donwell, be tempted away to his misery."	"austen"
"Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille."	"austen"
"I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you seeone of our small eggs will not hurt you."	"austen"
"We are sure of excellent fires, continued he, and every thing in the greatest comfort."	"austen"
"I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove."	"austen"
"Her father's feelings were quite distinct."	"austen"
"Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love."	"austen"
"Emma, why is it that they are your enemies?"	"austen"
"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed, cried Emma."	"austen"
"Such a heartsuch a Harriet!"	"austen"
"But at present there was nothing more to be said."	"austen"
"It is to be a secret, I conclude, said he."	"austen"
"If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work."	"austen"
"It is too smallwants strength."	"austen"
"I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to death."	"austen"
"As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree."	"austen"
"Then it would not be so strong a sense."	"austen"
"Instead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of Can it really be as my brother imagined?"	"austen"
"Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command."	"austen"
"She had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period."	"austen"
"Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could."	"austen"
"By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment."	"austen"
"Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here?"	"austen"
"My dear Harriet, what are you thinking of?"	"austen"
"It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December."	"austen"
"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that,said Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done."	"austen"
"Are you speaking ofMr."	"austen"
"They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers."	"austen"
"But she was not wanted to speak."	"austen"
"She did not do any of it in the same way that she used; I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to try to be very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no more what I saidI was in such a tremble!I remember she said she was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind!"	"austen"
"Emma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed,aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible."	"austen"
"When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that the world I could give upparties, balls, playsfor I had no fear of retirement."	"austen"
"I knew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had been doing."	"austen"
"She is not entirely without it, I think."	"austen"
"He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves."	"austen"
"Will you be so kind, said she, when I am missed, as to say that I am gone home?I am going this moment.My aunt is not aware how late it is, nor how long we have been absentbut I am sure we shall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.I have said nothing about it to any body."	"austen"
"It was a very extraordinary thing!"	"austen"
"I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married."	"austen"
"John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children."	"austen"
"I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if we could be shaken together."	"austen"
"She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious!"	"austen"
"cried Harriet indignantly.Oh!"	"austen"
"One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in, she said, was that of making her unreasonable."	"austen"
"Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all."	"austen"
"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself."	"austen"
"I see nobody else looking like her!I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion."	"austen"
"You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill."	"austen"
"said she: did you ever sit for your picture?"	"austen"
"Consider, she is sitting downwhich naturally presents a differentwhich in short gives exactly the ideaand the proportions must be preserved, you know."	"austen"
"I am perfectly comfortable to-day."	"austen"
"Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt, and her elegant niece,Mrs."	"austen"
"She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait."	"austen"
"She was your governess, I think?"	"austen"
"I thought it very well done of him indeed."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject."	"austen"
"Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her fortunethough her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estatewas not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off with due decorum."	"austen"
"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?I pity you.I thought you clevererfor, depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck."	"austen"
"CHAPTER IX Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with herself."	"austen"
"I will keep my ill-humour to myself."	"austen"
"Presently the carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to her."	"austen"
"The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again."	"austen"
"Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comforthow certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing him companyMr."	"austen"
"We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday."	"austen"
"We must begin; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon."	"austen"
"We really seem quite the fashion."	"austen"
"dear, I thought it would have been the death of me!"	"austen"
"That is what you have in your head, I knowand what you would certainly say if my father were not by."	"austen"
"Full of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest."	"austen"
"Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk."	"austen"
"What is right to be done cannot be done too soon."	"austen"
"No, the young lady, to be sure."	"austen"
"In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her."	"austen"
"He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose thoughts were on the Bates's, said It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined!"	"austen"
"My dear sir, you are too obliging."	"austen"
"Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a draught."	"austen"
"She is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school."	"austen"
"Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss."	"austen"
"Her connexions may be worse than his."	"austen"
"He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at others."	"austen"
"Why, to own the truth, cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes, if I must speak on this subject, there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might haveI do not mean to say that he did not dream itI am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the worldbut if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselvesbut it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days."	"austen"
"I have taken some pains for your sake, and for Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her."	"austen"
"No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting with her father.Mr."	"austen"
"The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again; and Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and unattended by any alarming young man."	"austen"
"I cannot make speeches, Emma: he soon resumed; and in a tone of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing.If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more."	"austen"
"Now, my dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude before."	"austen"
"The ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to freeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner."	"austen"
"said she, beginning again when they were all in the street."	"austen"
"No, indeed you are mistaken."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton, who might marry any body!"	"austen"
"It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma's charity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not."	"austen"
"you were perfectly right!"	"austen"
"My acquaintance with him has been but trifling.And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he may yet turn out well.With such a woman he has a chance.I have no motive for wishing him illand for her sake, whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him well."	"austen"
"She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every part as she proceededand he was very much pleased, and, as she had foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion."	"austen"
"As to thatI do not Oh!"	"austen"
"You speak as if you envied him."	"austen"
"You will not see him."	"austen"
"Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him."	"austen"
"Yes, indeed, there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it."	"austen"
"'You must all spend your evening with us,' said she'I positively must have you all come.'"	"austen"
"I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument."	"austen"
"Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown."	"austen"
"It is not likely that I should, considering what I have been used to."	"austen"
"I perfectly agree with you, sir,was then his remark."	"austen"
"Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off."	"austen"
"She should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment."	"austen"
"Henceforward I know nothing of the matter."	"austen"
"He beganstopping, however, almost directly to say, Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity."	"austen"
"Emma will be happy to entertain you."	"austen"
"You think so, do not you?"	"austen"
"When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?She looked back; she compared the twocompared them, as they had always stood in her estimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to herand as they must at any time have been compared by her, had itoh!"	"austen"
"Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerfulMr."	"austen"
"I have not an ideaI cannot guess it in the least."	"austen"
"actually resolve to break with him entirely!She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to eachshe dissolved it.What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!Well, he must be a most extraordinary Nay, nay, read on.You will find how very much he suffers."	"austen"
"Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off."	"austen"
"It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.She joined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around."	"austen"
"I hope, said he presently, I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill."	"austen"
"In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way."	"austen"
"I have nothing to do with William's wants, but it really is of very great importance that I should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose."	"austen"
"At present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma's side."	"austen"
"what do you mean?Mistake you!Am I to suppose then?"	"austen"
"CHAPTER XV Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared."	"austen"
"There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else."	"austen"
"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it."	"austen"
"She must have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma."	"austen"
"I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend."	"austen"
"Only think of our happening to meet him!How very odd!"	"austen"
"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five couple there will be plenty of room."	"austen"
"To give up one's child!"	"austen"
"There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts."	"austen"
"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very proper, handsome letter it was."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped the young lady's pride would now be contented; and supposed she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could; and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, Rather he than I!But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.Poor Knightley!"	"austen"
"Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent."	"austen"
"there is one difficulty unprovided for, cried Emma."	"austen"
"The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival."	"austen"
"I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour."	"austen"
"How is Miss Fairfax?I hope she caught no cold last night."	"austen"
"A large party secures its own amusement."	"austen"
"It seems an impossibility!You cannot mean to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin."	"austen"
"Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves."	"austen"
"Christmas weather, observed Mr. Elton."	"austen"
"The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never."	"austen"
"Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet."	"austen"
"Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought, entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley's excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it to be Dixon."	"austen"
"You are afraid of giving me trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am."	"austen"
"There was no denying that those brothers had penetration."	"austen"
"when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about!"	"austen"
"Never better.Don't I hear another carriage?Who can this be?very likely the worthy Coles.Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among such friends!"	"austen"
"Oftentimes very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing."	"austen"
"Have you finished it?"	"austen"
"But while I visit at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any body can do."	"austen"
"I will have nothing to do with it."	"austen"
"I made her take her shawlfor the evenings are not warmher large new shawl Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.So kind of her to think of my mother!"	"austen"
"He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some timeand then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.He was very much agitatedvery much, indeedto a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion ofand there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal."	"austen"
"Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!Can you explain it?"	"austen"
"Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagusso she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much concerned!Well, this is brilliant!"	"austen"
"Frank was here in February for a fortnight."	"austen"
"She must abide by the evil of having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do."	"austen"
"But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me."	"austen"
"Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay thought, he cried, Ah!"	"austen"
"He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion."	"austen"
"Harriet had not been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her, written in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a great deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return, and wishing to do more than she dared to confess."	"austen"
"yesshe will have her own room, of course; the room she always has;and there is the nursery for the children,just as usual, you know."	"austen"
"well, that must be infinitely provoking!"	"austen"
"Where features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good, the effect wasfortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was."	"austen"
"We must go in the carriage, to be sure."	"austen"
"But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he did know what he was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives."	"austen"
"I thought it must be so."	"austen"
"Jane Fairfax has feeling, said Mr. KnightleyI do not accuse her of want of feeling."	"austen"
"An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's parting words."	"austen"
"John Knightley's being a lawyer is very inconvenient.Poor Isabella!she is sadly taken away from us all!and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see Miss Taylor here!"	"austen"
"She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now."	"austen"
"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse, she resumed, that you should feel a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body."	"austen"
"Miss Hawkins,I dare say, an excellent young woman."	"austen"
"So I said, I was very much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and then he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stablesI believe I didbut I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it."	"austen"
"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing."	"austen"
"It would be the greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there."	"austen"
"The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible."	"austen"
"She admired him for contriving it, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced."	"austen"
"She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which always closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware."	"austen"
"I am quite sure, he replied, speaking very distinctly, that he told me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so."	"austen"
"Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?"	"austen"
"My first enjoyment, replied John Knightley, as they passed through the sweep-gate, will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again."	"austen"
"Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself."	"austen"
"I saw her as I came in; she was standing in the entrance."	"austen"
"To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each; that is my idea of him."	"austen"
"With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual."	"austen"
"Keep your raptures for Harriet's face."	"austen"
"But now, she would rather it had not happened."	"austen"
"But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's house."	"austen"
"Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost."	"austen"
"I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other."	"austen"
"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth."	"austen"
"I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill's illness."	"austen"
"And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet's sake; if he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind, that it had been all her own work?"	"austen"
"Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marryand to marry strangers tooand the other half she could give to her own view of the subject."	"austen"
"Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as he exclaimed, A sore-throat!I hope not infectious."	"austen"
"You do quite right, said she;we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what it is."	"austen"
"The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she could not go to church."	"austen"
"As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own."	"austen"
"Part of my lace is gone, said she, and I do not know how I am to contrive."	"austen"
"I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any taste."	"austen"
"They are to be new set."	"austen"
"She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield."	"austen"
"She will break it to you better than I can."	"austen"
"Which makes his good manners the more valuable."	"austen"
"She felt immediately that she should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be."	"austen"
"Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of."	"austen"
"She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart, as to her deficiencybut none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable,a waste of timetiresome womenand all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and therefore she seldom went near them."	"austen"
"It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference."	"austen"
"I had no notion that he liked me so very much, said Harriet, contemplating the letter."	"austen"
"The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is best observed by meals within doors."	"austen"
"He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter."	"austen"
"said she; 'well, that is quite unexpected."	"austen"
"I hope not of a putrid infectious sort."	"austen"
"While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in."	"austen"
"I think they will neither of them do the other any good."	"austen"
"It did appearthere was no concealing itexactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!"	"austen"
"I promised my wife to leave it all to her."	"austen"
"And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper."	"austen"
"She and the children might stay very well."	"austen"
"You and I need not be afraid."	"austen"
"It was a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening."	"austen"
"I dare say my daughter will be here presently, Miss Woodhouse."	"austen"
"said she; that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to you."	"austen"
"As to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing."	"austen"
"I met her frequently at Weymouth."	"austen"
"Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your commandbut my dancing days are over."	"austen"
"my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to us."	"austen"
"I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can."	"austen"
"His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's should be finished therethat the same party should be collected, and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence."	"austen"
"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school, Harriet."	"austen"
"There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton since his going away."	"austen"
"Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband."	"austen"
"Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family as much as you chose;that isI do not knowif you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;yes, I really believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest."	"austen"
"Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianofortea very elegant looking instrumentnot a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and nieceentirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account, Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered itbut now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;of course it must be from Colonel Campbell."	"austen"
"She must have been a perpetual enemy."	"austen"
"The scene enlarged; two persons appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into Highbury;to Hartfield of course."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston, do not mistake me."	"austen"
"To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first endeavour."	"austen"
"We will follow them to Hartfield."	"austen"
"one can think of nothing else."	"austen"
"Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on."	"austen"
"She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother."	"austen"
"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps."	"austen"
"said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice."	"austen"
"I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home directlyI would not have you out in a shower!We think she is the better for Highbury already."	"austen"
"I do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice, said she.In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is there any allusion to making a sacrifice."	"austen"
"The beginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality."	"austen"
"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be under Mrs. Weston's care."	"austen"
"You must go to bed early, my dearand I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together."	"austen"
"The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for."	"austen"
"He stopped.Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not herself know what to think."	"austen"
"Soon afterwards he began again, How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion, Miss Fairfax."	"austen"
"And I hate Italian singing.There is no understanding a word of it."	"austen"
"This is saying very plainly'Pray, Miss Smith, give me leave to pay my addresses to you."	"austen"
"Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every body's words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire."	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room."	"austen"
"Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass."	"austen"
"It will not do to invite five couple."	"austen"
"He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration."	"austen"
"Shall I?Yes, I willI declare I willand you shall see how she takes it;whether she colours."	"austen"
"So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say, How is your niece, Miss Bates?I want to inquire after you all, but particularly your niece."	"austen"
"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?Nobody could have helped it."	"austen"
"Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards him, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes nothing at all."	"austen"
"The conversation was here interrupted."	"austen"
"She must understand you."	"austen"
"That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins."	"austen"
"You are comfortable because you are under command."	"austen"
"Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest model for any young woman."	"austen"
"Such a very kind attentionand so thoughtful an attention!the sort of thing that so few men would think of."	"austen"
"And, my dear, whenever he comes, you had better let him look at little Bella's throat."	"austen"
"The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwellsome of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply."	"austen"
"The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.Very extraordinary!And nobody knew at all which way he was gone."	"austen"
"Another song, however, was soon begged for."	"austen"
"A very serious sort, I assure you; still smiling."	"austen"
"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine And how could she bear such behaviour!"	"austen"
"Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration."	"austen"
"cried Emma feelingly."	"austen"
"A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited."	"austen"
"Aye, very true.I wish I could recollect more of it."	"austen"
"In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is, supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early."	"austen"
"I never met with her equal."	"austen"
"Harriet had business at Ford's.Emma thought it most prudent to go with her."	"austen"
"Mr. Churchill's loss would be dreadful indeed."	"austen"
"He had found her agitated and low.Frank Churchill was a villain."	"austen"
"I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day."	"austen"
"madness, if it is so; but I hope you are mistaken."	"austen"
"My mother's deafness is very trifling you seejust nothing at all."	"austen"
"I admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well."	"austen"
"He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtfuland in a manner which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said, So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?"	"austen"
"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longerbut it seems a case of necessity."	"austen"
"When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it aloudall that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as the subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady reflection, thus Very badthough it might have been worse.Playing a most dangerous game."	"austen"
"But sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining."	"austen"
"There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.No, I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly."	"austen"
"They are but too apt to give up music."	"austen"
"snows a little I see."	"austen"
"said Frank Churchill."	"austen"
"What is this?What is this?"	"austen"
"I cannot help suspecting him."	"austen"
"This is three times as large.And you have never any odd humours, my dear."	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma."	"austen"
"My dear Miss Woodhouse, said the latter, I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while, and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith."	"austen"
"His visit he would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done."	"austen"
"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it."	"austen"
"We were speaking of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with."	"austen"
"'Oh,' said he, 'wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;'For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.The rivet came out, you know, this morning.So very obliging!For my mother had no use of her spectaclescould not put them on."	"austen"
"And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club!"	"austen"
"Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely."	"austen"
"Perhaps it is paid already."	"austen"
"These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake, in the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston."	"austen"
"It soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again."	"austen"
"Call upon her, by all means."	"austen"
"I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure."	"austen"
"Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time?Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may have sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to depend upon contingencies and conveniences?"	"austen"
"Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it."	"austen"
"To be sitting long after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure."	"austen"
"It was badly done, indeed!"	"austen"
"Then changing from a frown to a smileNo, do not tell meI do not want to know what you mean.Where is my father?When are we to begin dancing?"	"austen"
"Upon my honour, said he very seriously, it does not."	"austen"
"I like him very much."	"austen"
"One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax."	"austen"
"It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it, said the young man, though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far; but in coming home I felt I might do any thing."	"austen"
"Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes Yes, our good Mrs. Elton."	"austen"
"There is an openness, a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in him, because there is so much good-humour with itbut that would not do to be copied."	"austen"
"Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you."	"austen"
"From perfect misery to perfect happiness!"	"austen"
"Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter's courage failed."	"austen"
"Mrs. Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone."	"austen"
"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;only consider how great it would have been.An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty."	"austen"
"She then took another line of expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed, I do not think it is so very small."	"austen"
"Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?"	"austen"
"He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him, returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door."	"austen"
"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?Here is your tippet."	"austen"
"That I am sure you would."	"austen"
"I did not immediately recollect."	"austen"
"With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body's destiny."	"austen"
"To that point went every leisure moment which her father's claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind."	"austen"
"There was no time for farther remark or explanation."	"austen"
"Very true, said Harriet."	"austen"
"Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she too was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf."	"austen"
"He was on the move immediately; but coming back, said, I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her."	"austen"
"here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us; thank you for the sight of it."	"austen"
"Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor."	"austen"
"As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid they would find no difficulty."	"austen"
"This proves that he can leave the Churchills."	"austen"
"Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen into her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove."	"austen"
"Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case."	"austen"
"Why does not Perry see her?"	"austen"
"Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his hurrying away."	"austen"
"He must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt, to lessen his repugnance."	"austen"
"She was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her agitation, which she rather thought was considerable."	"austen"
"Better than she ever used to do?You see how my father and Mrs. Weston doat upon her."	"austen"
"But what did such particulars explain?The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible to Emma."	"austen"
"What a blessing, that she never had any children!"	"austen"
"Emma listened, and then coolly said, I shall not be satisfied, unless he comes."	"austen"
"He told her the news."	"austen"
"We admired it so much, that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection."	"austen"
"And so excellent in the Church!"	"austen"
"A house of her own!But where is the advantage of a house of her own?"	"austen"
"Emma called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she listened, and smiled, and congratulated."	"austen"
"Every thing turns out for his good.He meets with a young woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her by negligent treatmentand had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found her superior.His aunt is in the way.His aunt dies.He has only to speak.His friends are eager to promote his happiness.He had used every body illand they are all delighted to forgive him.He is a fortunate man indeed!"	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he would shew them all to Emma;fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was slow, constant, and methodical.Before this second looking over was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the houseand was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape.Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of."	"austen"
"I have a note of his.Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?"	"austen"
"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle."	"austen"
"I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is not offended."	"austen"
"I have been but half a friend to her; and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her;William CoxeOh!"	"austen"
"She was happy, she knew she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy."	"austen"
"The muffin last nightif it had been handed round once, I think it would have been enough."	"austen"
"I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you."	"austen"
"There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interestone object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak of nobody else."	"austen"
"A Miss Hawkinsthat's all I know."	"austen"
"The evil day was put off."	"austen"
"Very like Maple Grove indeed!She was quite struck by the likeness!That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room.Mr."	"austen"
"My dear Miss WoodhouseI come quite over-powered."	"austen"
"And such a noble fire!I am quite roasted."	"austen"
"These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the strawberry-beds.The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or talkingstrawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or spoken of.The best fruit in Englandevery body's favouritealways wholesome.These the finest beds and finest sorts.Delightful to gather for one's selfthe only way of really enjoying them.Morning decidedly the best timenever tiredevery sort goodhautboy infinitely superiorno comparisonthe others hardly eatablehautboys very scarceChili preferredwhite wood finest flavour of allprice of strawberries in Londonabundance about BristolMaple Grovecultivationbeds when to be renewedgardeners thinking exactly differentno general rulegardeners never to be put out of their waydelicious fruitonly too rich to be eaten much ofinferior to cherriescurrants more refreshingonly objection to gathering strawberries the stoopingglaring suntired to deathcould bear it no longermust go and sit in the shade."	"austen"
"You have made yourself too clear."	"austen"
"Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the Wallises, alwaysI have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them."	"austen"
"I dared not address her openly; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.Had she refused, I should have gone mad.But you will be ready to say, what was your hope in doing this?What did you look forward to?To any thing, every thingto time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness."	"austen"
"He thought we walked towards Randalls most days."	"austen"
"He came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith."	"austen"
"Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"There is no saying, indeed, replied Harriet rather solemnly."	"austen"
"and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that really is the reason why the instrument was boughtor else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening."	"austen"
"Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the gentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet's friend."	"austen"
"Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw."	"austen"
"Even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes."	"austen"
"Every body knows what is due to you."	"austen"
"In half a minute they were together."	"austen"
"He called her 'Augusta.'"	"austen"
"you clever creature, that's very true."	"austen"
"She wentshe had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.The fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.No; she heard nothing but the instant reply of, Beg her to walk up;and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging."	"austen"
"Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too much beloved to be parted with."	"austen"
"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still, said Emma."	"austen"
"My dear Emma, we must consider this."	"austen"
"Knightley!I could not have believed it."	"austen"
"He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage."	"austen"
"I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room, and I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage."	"austen"
"yes, I am quite aware of that."	"austen"
"shark is only one syllable."	"austen"
"For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose."	"austen"
"Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us."	"austen"
"If he were, he would have done this differently."	"austen"
"They must not do less than others, or she should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful resentment."	"austen"
"What is passable in youth is detestable in later age."	"austen"
"Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room?She who could do any thing in Highbury!"	"austen"
"This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed, My dear madam!"	"austen"
"Knightley and I both saying we liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too."	"austen"
"Yes, he replied, any body may know how highly I think of her."	"austen"
"She wished him to speak, but he would not."	"austen"
"But here is my father coming: you will not object to my reading the charade to him."	"austen"
"You are his objectand you will soon receive the completest proof of it."	"austen"
"I have a very sincere interest in Emma."	"austen"
"And cannot you call me 'George' now?"	"austen"
"Emma, said she, this paper is worse than I expected."	"austen"
"Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this the best offer she was likely to have."	"austen"
"There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will do for themselves."	"austen"
"Miss Nash had been telling her something, which she repeated immediately with great delight."	"austen"
"The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very inferior to her own.Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a most pitiful business!Selina would stare when she heard of it.But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union."	"austen"
"Whether it was his own idea you know, one cannot tell."	"austen"
"And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through the passage, was calling out, You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear."	"austen"
"Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it."	"austen"
"I cannot keep my eyes from it."	"austen"
"Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him."	"austen"
"A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood."	"austen"
"He told me at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now."	"austen"
"There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!and the face not unlike."	"austen"
"As Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour."	"austen"
"This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning."	"austen"
"That was your name for him, was it?"	"austen"
"She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as the church, he would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with."	"austen"
"I can never bear to think of you all there without me."	"austen"
"You must answer it of courseand speedily."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmasthough you know it is longer since they were with him, than with us."	"austen"
"I often feel concern, said she, that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions."	"austen"
"The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet's side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis, No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin, that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature."	"austen"
"What felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy!If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth."	"austen"
"She was not yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little she saw it all."	"austen"
"My dearest Emma, said he, for dearest you will always be, whatever the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most beloved Emmatell me at once."	"austen"
"Peculiarly lucky!for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath, or any public place, can giveit is all nothing; there can be no knowledge."	"austen"
"In another moment a happier sight caught her;Mr. Knightley leading Harriet to the set!Never had she been more surprized, seldom more delighted, than at that instant."	"austen"
"He would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his bride."	"austen"
"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?And how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter?I dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming."	"austen"
"To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject, for the first start of its possibility."	"austen"
"Did he appear a sensible young man; a young man of information?At a watering-place, or in a common London acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points."	"austen"
"She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad."	"austen"
"How trifling they make every thing else appear!I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?"	"austen"
"my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any uneasiness about it."	"austen"
"If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly airedbut is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted?"	"austen"
"Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions."	"austen"
"I remembered what I used to do myself."	"austen"
"said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of hearing:How well they suit one another!Very luckymarrying as they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!They only knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath!"	"austen"
"Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.But, with common sense, she added, I am afraid I have had little to do."	"austen"
"I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably settled."	"austen"
"And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, 'I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time for writing;' and when I immediately said, 'But indeed we have, we had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized."	"austen"
"He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious."	"austen"
"yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance."	"austen"
"I wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?"	"austen"
"Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and obliging."	"austen"
"They did as they were desired; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield."	"austen"
"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment."	"austen"
"What!engaged to her all the winterbefore either of them came to Highbury?"	"austen"
"Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?"	"austen"
"Here is the rivet of your mistress's spectacles out."	"austen"
"Never had the exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her."	"austen"
"One more;they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more."	"austen"
"papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married."	"austen"
"What was I talking of?"	"austen"
"What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion higher than Robert Martin?"	"austen"
"And that you should have been so mistaken, is amazing!I am sure, but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost, to dare to think of him."	"austen"
"Three o'clock yesterday!"	"austen"
"An arch look expressedI understand you well enough; but she said only, Miss Fairfax is reserved."	"austen"
"It is not that I am without the wish; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-to for such a purpose."	"austen"
"I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet."	"austen"
"She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself, while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness, Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed."	"austen"
"then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so very happy to see herand now we are such a nice party, she cannot refuse."	"austen"
"Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many years ago, when I had the measles?"	"austen"
"That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs. Bates's house."	"austen"
"I do not understand what you mean by 'success,' said Mr. Knightley."	"austen"
"I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you."	"austen"
"She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; but their going to Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father."	"austen"
"We know, on the contrary, that he has so much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom."	"austen"
"They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox."	"austen"
"She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint."	"austen"
"She was afterwards looking for her shawlFrank Churchill was looking alsoit was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell."	"austen"
"There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are."	"austen"
"Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a sensation his coming will produce?"	"austen"
"One is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted."	"austen"
"Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend."	"austen"
"I managed it extremely well."	"austen"
"These days of confinement would have been, but for her private perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited her brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield."	"austen"
"There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them."	"austen"
"But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me."	"austen"
"The ball proceeded pleasantly."	"austen"
"At present, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice."	"austen"
"She is not the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be."	"austen"
"The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable."	"austen"
"I went only to the post-office, said she, and reached home before the rain was much."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!"	"austen"
"Weston, tell me at once.Something has happened in Brunswick Square."	"austen"
"And the staircaseYou know, as I came in, I observed how very like the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house."	"austen"
"I must not dwell upon it, said she.I must not think of it."	"austen"
"Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that people should like her so much."	"austen"
"They are ripening fast."	"austen"
"Have you indeed no idea?"	"austen"
"Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mindand it must be saving her from the danger of degradation."	"austen"
"I have a right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin.She did not suspect him."	"austen"
"The touch seemed immediate."	"austen"
"I had quite determined to go away again."	"austen"
"It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words, not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw."	"austen"
"Now I say, my dear, in our case, for lady, readmum!"	"austen"
"I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and styleCandles everywhere.I was telling you of your grandmama, Jane,There was a little disappointment.The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again."	"austen"
"He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness."	"austen"
"Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the information she received more valuable."	"austen"
"Shall we walk, Augusta?"	"austen"
"You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other."	"austen"
"Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest."	"austen"
"I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston?"	"austen"
"The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other."	"austen"
"Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself."	"austen"
"It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure was odious."	"austen"
"I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I should in the course of the summer."	"austen"
"He could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their proper place the next morning."	"austen"
"I hope you will bring Elton, said he: but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations."	"austen"
"I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description."	"austen"
"That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable."	"austen"
"They are jealous even of his regard for his father."	"austen"
"No,he calmly replied,there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and that one is Mrs. Weston, I suppose, interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified."	"austen"
"Such a sad loss to our party to-day!"	"austen"
"It will not do, whispered Frank to Emma; they are most of them affronted."	"austen"
"He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father's having any right to complain."	"austen"
"He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton's praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being very pleasant and very elegantly dressed."	"austen"
"But I can remember nothing;not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are several."	"austen"
"Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane, and his next words were, Did you ever see such a skin?such smoothness!"	"austen"
"She loves him then excessively, I suppose."	"austen"
"she cried in evident embarrassment, it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves."	"austen"
"And I will own to you, (I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled."	"austen"
"Had it taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance."	"austen"
"That's true, she criedvery true."	"austen"
"Mrs. Hodges may well be angry."	"austen"
"I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma."	"austen"
"Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax."	"austen"
"Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'something which, you knew, I did not approve."	"austen"
"Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible."	"austen"
"And she is a good-natured woman after all."	"austen"
"The only way of proving it, however, will be to turn to our maps."	"austen"
"In short, I can feel no dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine."	"austen"
"Her change was equal.This one half-hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.On his side, there had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation, of Frank Churchill.He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other."	"austen"
"She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just nothing at all."	"austen"
"It is not likely you should ever have observed him; but he knows you very well indeedI mean by sight."	"austen"
"The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, My brother Mr. Suckling's seat;a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove."	"austen"
"No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed, What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be!"	"austen"
"and she had difficulty in behaving with temper."	"austen"
"Elton is a very good sort of man, and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make an imprudent match."	"austen"
"They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill."	"austen"
"You must have heard every thing to be sure."	"austen"
"papathat is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do not think you ever will."	"austen"
"Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancingoriginating nobody exactly knew wherewas so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space."	"austen"
"The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and there she had no doubt."	"austen"
"She could not be complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence."	"austen"
"He proved to me that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better."	"austen"
"after the note I sent him this morning, and the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one."	"austen"
"Harriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage, and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her."	"austen"
"Mrs. Elton had received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures."	"austen"
"Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing does give you cold."	"austen"
"Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew."	"austen"
"It will give you every thing that you wantconsideration, independence, a proper homeit will fix you in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever."	"austen"
"Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you knowin a jokeit is all a joke."	"austen"
"Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat."	"austen"
"Emma's sense of right however had decided it; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper invitation."	"austen"
"I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day."	"austen"
"He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy."	"austen"
"But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny."	"austen"
"But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism."	"austen"
"I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else."	"austen"
"Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare say in her's."	"austen"
"What is the matter now?"	"austen"
"And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone."	"austen"
"Low, I am afraid, sir, very low, answered his son;but we shall be indulgentespecially to any one who leads the way."	"austen"
"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama."	"austen"
"They seem very comfortable as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably repent it."	"austen"
"Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins."	"austen"
"He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow."	"austen"
"what would Frank Churchill say to her, if he were here?"	"austen"
"Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurityand most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed."	"austen"
"I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me."	"austen"
"Weston was alone in the drawing-room:but hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window."	"austen"
"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax, said Emma."	"austen"
"Come, Jane, take my other arm."	"austen"
"The conviction seemed real; he looked as if he felt it."	"austen"
"He might observe that it was so."	"austen"
"He has a great regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfaxand is always glad to shew them attention."	"austen"
"They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways."	"austen"
"for I think you have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.''Oh!"	"austen"
"Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of every thing."	"austen"
"They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.Well, my dear, said he, as they entered the roomI have brought her, and now I hope you will soon be better."	"austen"
"The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind."	"austen"
"She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates!"	"austen"
"He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits, without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's."	"austen"
"yesdid not you know?Well, well, never mind."	"austen"
"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays."	"austen"
"She seems quite recovered now."	"austen"
"Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates and her niece, who had accidentally met."	"austen"
"She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so much to blame in his conduct."	"austen"
"Mr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party."	"austen"
"Emma laughed and disclaimed."	"austen"
"Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind."	"austen"
"Miss Bates looked about her, so happily!"	"austen"
"And after such success, you know!Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again."	"austen"
"Now I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you."	"austen"
"Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any thing...."	"austen"
"She could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable."	"austen"
"Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage."	"austen"
"If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder."	"austen"
"On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing:Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was distasteful."	"austen"
"She saw it all; and entering into her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend."	"austen"
"NoIt will not be worth while."	"austen"
"Her ignorance is hourly flattery."	"austen"
"Emma smiled and answeredMy visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it is a most severe cold indeed."	"austen"
"I have really for some time past, for at least these three months, cared nothing about him."	"austen"
"And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood."	"austen"
"good I am sure.I see it in your countenance."	"austen"
"said Mrs. Weston, have not you finished it yet?"	"austen"
"She then broke the lace off short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort."	"austen"

"Emma was in no danger of forgetting."	"austen"

"He fancied bathing might be good for itthe warm bathbut she says it did him no lasting benefit."	"austen"
"What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it."	"austen"
"She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love, if not in love already."	"austen"
"My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour."	"austen"
"Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ, said Frank Churchill, with a smile at Emma, the person has not chosen ill."	"austen"
"I have not a fault to find with her person, he replied."	"austen"
"I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning."	"austen"
"She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery."	"austen"
"my dear, it is not like Hartfield."	"austen"
"But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my guard."	"austen"
"It had no advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes.Emma's remark was There it is."	"austen"
"And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn off."	"austen"
"The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease."	"austen"
"She would rather not be in his company more than she could help."	"austen"
"Her spirits seemed overcome."	"austen"
"It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd, that Emma did not know how to understand it."	"austen"
"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again."	"austen"
"For my companion tells me, said she, that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night, that I would come this morning."	"austen"
"I will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world."	"austen"
"Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both, either at Randalls or hereand as you may suppose, Isabella, most frequently here."	"austen"
"I will answer for the gentleman's indifference."	"austen"
"Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately?"	"austen"
"He had not been at Donwell for two years."	"austen"
"His company so sought after, that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week."	"austen"
"Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before."	"austen"
"Then, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard'sI do not knowNo, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night."	"austen"
"And a fine endingand there is the letter."	"austen"
"This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come."	"austen"
"Would not Harriet be the very creature described?"	"austen"
"But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown, quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk, unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street."	"austen"
"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are."	"austen"
"I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow."	"austen"
"They must be separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the processso much to herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it."	"austen"
"Well, that is so very!I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to give her your arm.Mr."	"austen"
"I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him."	"austen"
"Harriet was a little distresseddid look a little foolish at first: but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley's, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight."	"austen"
"Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.How do you do?"	"austen"
"Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin?"	"austen"
"It must be all conjecture."	"austen"
"Better be without sense, than misapply it as you do."	"austen"
"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness indeed!"	"austen"
"After a mutual silence of some minutes, Harriet thus began again I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or going to be married!"	"austen"
"She has talked of it since."	"austen"
"Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air."	"austen"
"He might be superseded by another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cure her."	"austen"
"HumphHarriet's ready wit!"	"austen"
"'What does this mean?"	"austen"
"This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too."	"austen"
"As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe."	"austen"
"Because, replied he, smiling, among the rest of the objects before me, I see a very dirty lane."	"austen"
"With me!in the utmost amazementwell, sir,be quickand if you canless violent."	"austen"
"It would be something remarkable, now, he continued, something droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time."	"austen"
"There now, YOU are going to laugh at me too."	"austen"
"and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when Colonel Brandon appeared."	"austen"
"But indeed, while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof."	"austen"
"I am sure, replied Elinor, with a smile, that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that."	"austen"
"I never was at his house; but they say it is a sweet pretty place."	"austen"
"We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday!"	"austen"
"The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure."	"austen"
"But why should such precaution be used?Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,for THAT must be quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she supposed to feel at all?She has done with her son, she cast him off for ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast him off likewise."	"austen"
"Elinor's heart was full."	"austen"
"The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,he replied, with great feeling,of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long attached to each other, is terrible."	"austen"
"She had not seen him before since his engagement became public, and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes."	"austen"
"I am afraid, replied Elinor, that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety."	"austen"
"Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps, at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest."	"austen"
"how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there!"	"austen"
"How few people know what comfort is!"	"austen"
"If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings, said Marianne, at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation."	"austen"
"Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, received additional charms from his voice and expression."	"austen"
"Nay, the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more than friendship."	"austen"
"What an ill-natured woman his mother is, an't she?"	"austen"
"You are very kind, said Lady Middleton to Elinor; and as you really like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber, or will you take your chance now?"	"austen"
"But last February, almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared."	"austen"
"Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt for all your sakes."	"austen"
"Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart?"	"austen"
"Oh, barbarously insolent!Elinor, can he be justified?"	"austen"
"If dancing formed the amusement of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else."	"austen"
"Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has."	"austen"
"A very desirable connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time."	"austen"
"His wife was not always out of humour, nor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs, and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity."	"austen"
"It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her education myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school."	"austen"
"In Edwardshe knew not what she saw, nor what she wished to see;happy or unhappy,nothing pleased her; she turned away her head from every sketch of him."	"austen"
"When I first became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before."	"austen"
"I think I have, replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which increased with her increase of emotion."	"austen"
"About four days after Edward's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to complete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of having, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company with her than her house would hold."	"austen"
"You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy."	"austen"
"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear."	"austen"
"There is no knowing what THEY may expect, said the lady, but we are not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can afford to do."	"austen"
"Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little."	"austen"
"MY happiness never was his object."	"austen"
"He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address!"	"austen"
"Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever."	"austen"
"It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect."	"austen"
"The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduous attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, and re-established him completely in her favour."	"austen"
"Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore not able to come to them."	"austen"
"No, I cannot think that."	"austen"
"I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs!"	"austen"
"He is very little at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you know, and besides it is such a way off."	"austen"
"I cannot afford to lose ONE hour."	"austen"
"She speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all her established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be, was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate."	"austen"
"Colonel Brandon alone, of all the party, heard her without being in raptures."	"austen"
"But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today?"	"austen"
"Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton?"	"austen"
"Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like."	"austen"
"Your business cannot be with ME."	"austen"
"My dear, said he to his lady, it is very provoking that we should be so few."	"austen"
"When she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply was not very auspicious."	"austen"
"a very agreeable young man to be sure; I know him very well."	"austen"
"I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I DO beg you will favour me with your company, for I've quite set my heart upon it."	"austen"
"With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them, they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their completion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor, as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn."	"austen"
"Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing indulged."	"austen"
"I do assure you, he replied, that I have long thought on this point, as you think now."	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to take her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 9 The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to themselves."	"austen"
"He put the letter into Elinor's hands."	"austen"
"In the height of her morality, good woman!"	"austen"
"Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone."	"austen"
"No, ma'am, for my mistress."	"austen"
"With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got up and hurried out of the room."	"austen"
"Happy had it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations!"	"austen"
"This was gaining something, something to look forward to."	"austen"
"My mother was quite sick of it."	"austen"
"A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight, was exactly what suited her mind."	"austen"
"Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us."	"austen"
"Your wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect, at least."	"austen"
"To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match."	"austen"
"I have some little concern in the business, as well as yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good husband."	"austen"
"A few moments' reflection, however, produced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed; Oh, ho!I understand you."	"austen"
"You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth."	"austen"
"Her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose."	"austen"
"It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was formed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost always with us afterwards."	"austen"
"They all rose up in preparation for a round game."	"austen"
"Elinor looked as if she wished to hear more."	"austen"
"May be his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over."	"austen"
"You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the side of your wishes."	"austen"
"And away she went; but returning again in a moment, I have just been thinking of Betty's sister, my dear."	"austen"
"Are you quite sure of it?"	"austen"
"Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting; for she calmly replied, Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street."	"austen"
"The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others."	"austen"
"was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose mindOh!"	"austen"
"I hope you like your house, Miss Marianne."	"austen"
"In short, it is a kind of thing thatlowering his voice to an important whisperwill be exceedingly welcome to ALL PARTIES."	"austen"
"It was a night of almost equal suffering to both."	"austen"
"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived, repeated Sir John."	"austen"
"And Marianne was in spirits; happy in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation of a frost."	"austen"
"If, indeed, it could be restored to our poor little boy Why, to be sure, said her husband, very gravely, that would make great difference."	"austen"
"I shall go to the piano-forte; I have not touched it since it was tuned."	"austen"
"Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence."	"austen"
"Forgive me, forgive me, throwing her arms round her sister's neck; I know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you areyou must be happy; Edward loves youwhat, oh what, can do away such happiness as that?"	"austen"
"Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so interesting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross her memory, her reflection, and her fancy."	"austen"
"Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to punishment."	"austen"
"HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return."	"austen"
"And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure."	"austen"
"And what sort of a young man is he?"	"austen"
"She paused.Her daughter could not quite agree with her, but her dissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence."	"austen"
"Elinor bowed her assent."	"austen"
"But you would still be reserved, said Marianne, and that is worse."	"austen"
"Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she thought she could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters."	"austen"
"It was an unaccountable business."	"austen"
"This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking with surprise at them both."	"austen"
"His character, however, answered Elinor, does not rest on ONE act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of the case, would have prompted him."	"austen"
"That he is patronised by YOU, replied Willoughby, is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in itself."	"austen"
"She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself."	"austen"
"The deception could not continue after this; and an explanation immediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first."	"austen"
"How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven in showers about me by the wind!"	"austen"
"To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother."	"austen"
"I never could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or later I must have known, all this.I should have had no confidence, no esteem."	"austen"
"You cannot doubt your sister's wishes."	"austen"
"cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, I shall be quite disappointed if you do not."	"austen"
"This will probably be the case, he replied; and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions."	"austen"
"As for Lucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of Edward for her."	"austen"
"Marianne was still handsomer."	"austen"
"But this I can say, that if he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him."	"austen"
"And in all probability you will see your brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife, when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other."	"austen"
"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass, replied Elinor, and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid."	"austen"
"You are mistaken, Elinor, said she warmly, in supposing I know very little of Willoughby."	"austen"
"no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that."	"austen"
"Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is in orders already."	"austen"
"But though so much of the matter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking after more, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them within that time."	"austen"
"That is very true, replied her mother, but of her society, separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing at all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton."	"austen"
"He then really thought himself equal to it."	"austen"
"The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence."	"austen"
"She got up with a headache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment; giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either."	"austen"
"Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life, as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant; called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them."	"austen"
"His affection was all her own."	"austen"
"She liked himin spite of his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest."	"austen"
"Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared."	"austen"
"Elinor read and returned it without any comment."	"austen"
"And how came he not to have settled that matter before this person's death?NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it, but a man of Colonel Brandon's sense!I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common, such natural, concern!Well, I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character."	"austen"
"I considered the past: I saw in my own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of kindness to others."	"austen"
"Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished, and she might have immediate possession."	"austen"
"Let her name her own supper, and go to bed."	"austen"
"Lodging as I did in Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us so long."	"austen"
"But the effort was painful."	"austen"
"From such commendation as this, however, there was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of England, under every possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding."	"austen"
"Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever."	"austen"
"And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine!"	"austen"
"For Marianne, howeverin spite of his incivility in surviving her losshe always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon."	"austen"
"But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fine enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most easily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation."	"austen"
"You have heard, I suppose, said he with great solemnity, as soon as he was seated, of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday."	"austen"
"On Elinor its effect was very different."	"austen"
"and by all accounts, it won't come before it's wanted; for they say he is all to pieces."	"austen"
"To London!and are you going this morning?"	"austen"
"But (with a little return of anxiety) it cannot be expected to last long."	"austen"
"Have you no comforts?"	"austen"
"Whatever they may have been, however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which must attend her through life."	"austen"
"Lady Elliott wished to give a dance."	"austen"
"Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there be that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities and an excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid."	"austen"
"She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer."	"austen"
"He then made his bow, and departed with the rest."	"austen"
"I am not fond of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms."	"austen"
"Yes, yes, I will go and see her, sure enough."	"austen"
"At the park she laughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne."	"austen"
"But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read, or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much in favour of her amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed, more and more indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister's composure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole day, against Marianne's inclination, and forcing proper medicines on her at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of sleep, and felt no real alarm."	"austen"
"Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends."	"austen"
"But they had no curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way."	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not stand upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her sisters to see her."	"austen"
"Fanny was startled at the proposal."	"austen"
"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother."	"austen"
"The carriages were then ordered; Willoughby's was first, and Marianne never looked happier than when she got into it."	"austen"
"Our first care has been to keep the matter secret."	"austen"
"The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with."	"austen"
"No taste for drawing!"	"austen"
"I have been more pained, said she, by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do."	"austen"
"Well, I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain."	"austen"
"Elinor's lips had moved with her mother's, and, when the moment of action was over, she wished that she had shaken hands with him too."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 18 Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend."	"austen"
"THAT was due to the folly of Robert, and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before many months had passed away."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 44 Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room, and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command than supplication, Miss Dashwood, for half an hourfor ten minutesI entreat you to stay."	"austen"
"And if they really DO interest themselves, said Marianne, in her new character of candour, in bringing about a reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit."	"austen"
"Between THEM no subject is finished, no communication is even made, till it has been made at least twenty times over."	"austen"
"She could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person for Lucy was particularly distinguishedwhom of all others, had they known as much as she did, they would have been most anxious to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively no power to wound them, sat pointedly slighted by both."	"austen"
"But why were you not there, Edward?Why did you not come?"	"austen"
"I thought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceive yourself any longer."	"austen"
"Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother's account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son."	"austen"
"They were engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this party, Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared, without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure."	"austen"
"or is it equally criminal in every body?"	"austen"
"He was not in spirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, was attentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits."	"austen"
"Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words, no smiles."	"austen"
"She saw her mother and Marianne change colour; saw them look at herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other."	"austen"
"I know Marianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible."	"austen"
"Though WE have not known him long, he is no stranger in this part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?"	"austen"
"Their favour increased; they could not be spared; Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately, which was in full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance."	"austen"
"It makes one detest all one's acquaintance."	"austen"
"To me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other."	"austen"
"I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 6 The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant."	"austen"
"Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement, said she, nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;but as that was not the case I guessed you would say so,replied Lucy quicklybut there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did not, and her liking me is every thing."	"austen"
"Well, I went, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was only indifferent."	"austen"
"Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!but we must allow for difference of taste."	"austen"
"Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!"	"austen"
"She would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible."	"austen"
"This, said he, cannot hold; but a change, a total change of sentimentsNo, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous!"	"austen"
"Certainly, answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after a moment's reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward's honour and love, and her companion's falsehoodEngaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me, that reallyI beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name."	"austen"
"They were all in high spirits and good humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise."	"austen"
"I have no pity for either of them."	"austen"
"To this determination she was the more easily reconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account, was not to be in town before February; and that their visit, without any unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished."	"austen"
"Her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it only dispirited her more."	"austen"
"she replied with spirited earnestness, though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, don't think of MY health."	"austen"
"He said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence."	"austen"
"I am so glad to see you!"	"austen"
"A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss Steele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now said rather abruptly, And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?"	"austen"
"It seems quite ridiculous."	"austen"
"What!while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your heart?And I have reproached you for being happy!"	"austen"
"When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found her just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes."	"austen"
"He really pressed them, with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his invitation was accepted."	"austen"
"What I felt on hearing that your sister was dyingand dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me in her latest momentsfor how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed?"	"austen"
"Cruel, cruelnothing can acquit you."	"austen"
"But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their education or state."	"austen"
"But you look grave, Marianne; do you disapprove your sister's choice?"	"austen"
"His visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect."	"austen"
"Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered: it was enoughHE was not thereand she sat down, equally ill-disposed to receive or communicate pleasure."	"austen"
"Poor little creatures!"	"austen"
"It has not made him happy."	"austen"
"Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house, situated on a sloping lawn."	"austen"
"No one made any objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility, exclaimed, Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse MEyou know I detest cards."	"austen"
"I do not know what I told her, he replied, impatiently; less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future."	"austen"
"He paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste."	"austen"
"She can never be more lost to you than she is now."	"austen"
"I shall call hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere."	"austen"
"How much could it not tempt her to forgive!"	"austen"
"She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks."	"austen"
"But I know very well what it is; and I know where he is too."	"austen"
"Certainly, he replied, with a sneerI came into Devonshire with no other view."	"austen"
"The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner, affording a pleasant enlargement of the party, and a very welcome variety to their conversation, which a long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low."	"austen"
"THIS morning I had fully intended to call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so much to do on first coming to town."	"austen"
"Elinor's heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation."	"austen"
"She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex, and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not."	"austen"
"Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and compassion."	"austen"
"He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away."	"austen"
"Elinor told him the number of the house."	"austen"
"It does not do him justice, to be sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was drew for.I have had it above these three years."	"austen"
"you will be glad of a little company to sit with you."	"austen"
"I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed."	"austen"
"The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them, or with us."	"austen"
"How often did I wish, added he, when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited!"	"austen"
"Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point."	"austen"
"Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want for more than that?They will live so cheap!"	"austen"
"He must be starved, you know;that is certain; absolutely starved."	"austen"
"And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour."	"austen"
"Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her, herself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!"	"austen"
"But your sister does notI think you said soshe does not consider quite as you do?"	"austen"
"About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on business, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, too restless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one window to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation."	"austen"
"I have always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems him highly."	"austen"
"But SHE does every thing well."	"austen"
"They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very well by Edward."	"austen"
"He understood that she was in need of a dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage, he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary, if the situation pleased her."	"austen"
"Nay, cried Mrs. Jennings, I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne's company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only the more the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back."	"austen"
"Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little, or at least so lately known to her."	"austen"
"He came to them every day."	"austen"
"how do you think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me."	"austen"
"how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion!"	"austen"
"They had not long finished their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to see them all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again."	"austen"
"He must and does love her I am sure."	"austen"
"Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy."	"austen"
"So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon as the Dashwoods' invitation was known, that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place."	"austen"
"Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle's, it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well."	"austen"
"Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground."	"austen"
"His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment."	"austen"
"I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon."	"austen"
"Yes, why should I stay here?"	"austen"
"The closing of the little gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the door."	"austen"
"No, ma'am, not even Lucy if you please."	"austen"
"He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy's letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the nearest road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct, with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection."	"austen"
"said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs togetherfor the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings, that they all followed the servant at the same timeThere is nobody here but you, that can feel for me.I declare I can hardly stand."	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take leave of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away without making her any reply!She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor."	"austen"
"The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings, and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address, who met her husband's sisters without any affection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence."	"austen"
"No, said Marianne, in a low voice, nor how many painful moments."	"austen"
"Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is?"	"austen"
"I never was more astonished in my life."	"austen"
"But she had promised to hear him, and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged."	"austen"
"I do not attempt to deny, said she, that I think very highly of himthat I greatly esteem, that I like him."	"austen"
"Marianne pressed her hand and replied, You are very good.The future must be my proof."	"austen"
"She was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood."	"austen"
"What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have puzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to it, might have puzzled them still more."	"austen"
"Mr. Palmer looked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and then returned to his newspaper."	"austen"
"I have no wish to be distinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall."	"austen"
"I love to be reminded of the past, Edwardwhether it be melancholy or gay, I love to recall itand you will never offend me by talking of former times."	"austen"
"Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event, and give farther particulars,but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no tidings."	"austen"
"Good gracious!In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends onthat is to be my mother!"	"austen"
"She sat by the drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton's arrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her attitude, lost in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sister's presence; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the door, she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected."	"austen"
"He may live twenty years longer."	"austen"
"Edward made no answer."	"austen"
"Some letters had passed between her and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness; and in the first of John's, there had been this sentence: We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject, but conclude him to be still at Oxford; which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters."	"austen"
"How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account for."	"austen"
"From this moment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day, made her unfit for any thing."	"austen"
"In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcome them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 37 Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her; and, contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day, returned from that period to her own home, and her own habits, in which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share."	"austen"
"And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in private."	"austen"
"(turning to Mrs. Dashwood) but you have made it so charming!"	"austen"
"Even THEN, however, when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I allowed myself most improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it, from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed."	"austen"
"cried Marianne, indignantly."	"austen"
"I avoided the Middletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common."	"austen"
"Well, said I, all I can say is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out."	"austen"
"Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son."	"austen"
"And they both long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told them it is all very true, and a great deal more."	"austen"
"Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night."	"austen"
"There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body."	"austen"
"To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away one's independence."	"austen"
"Again I demand an explanation of it."	"austen"
"Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands together, and cried, Gracious God!"	"austen"
"Her manners were attaching, and soon banished his reserve."	"austen"
"But he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery, which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence."	"austen"
"Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered."	"austen"
"He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries, but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed."	"austen"
"I can guess what his business is, however, said Mrs. Jennings exultingly."	"austen"
"The furniture was all sent around by water."	"austen"
"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you."	"austen"
"said she; 'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is to be managed."	"austen"
"Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire."	"austen"
"There was always a something,if you remember,in Willoughby's eyes at times, which I did not like."	"austen"
"My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation."	"austen"
"So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings."	"austen"
"Now, Palmer, you shall see a monstrous pretty girl."	"austen"
"Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two or three following days, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done; but while her resolution was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health."	"austen"
"Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power; and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more, had not Marianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability, not to speak to her for the world."	"austen"
"To have his love used so scornfully!"	"austen"
"No, Marianne, in no possible way."	"austen"
"Dullness is as much produced within doors as without, by rain."	"austen"
"Only look, sister, how delightful every thing is!"	"austen"
"If their praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust."	"austen"
"MY DEAR MADAM, I have just had the honour of receiving your letter, for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments."	"austen"
"Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort in London, and eager as she had long been to quit it, could not, when it came to the point, bid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby, which were now extinguished for ever, without great pain."	"austen"
"Marianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more."	"austen"
"All that could be done was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch."	"austen"
"Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days."	"austen"
"Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that."	"austen"
"He was under my uncle's care, you know, a considerable while."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 8 Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure."	"austen"
"The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it."	"austen"
"She was not a woman of many words; for, unlike people in general, she proportioned them to the number of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her, not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events."	"austen"
"But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches."	"austen"
"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose, said Elinor, in spite of the insufficiency of wealth."	"austen"
"And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment."	"austen"
"For the rest of his character and habits, they were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life."	"austen"
"Such a good-natured fellow!"	"austen"
"He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think, Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life."	"austen"
"Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor's heart wrung for the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother's threats, for a woman who could not reward him."	"austen"
"On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of his coming to Barton."	"austen"
"I was breakfasting at the Ellisons,and her letter, with some others, was brought to me there from my lodgings."	"austen"
"Beyond the entrance of the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less wild and more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point, they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before."	"austen"
"And without farther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument."	"austen"
"It was forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly, which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body, and which I believe gave offence to some."	"austen"
"Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy."	"austen"
"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles."	"austen"
"In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne that he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm."	"austen"
"The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them."	"austen"
"They are both delightful women, indeed!I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was!"	"austen"
"Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not an illusion of her own vanity."	"austen"
"Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled."	"austen"
"Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them."	"austen"
"Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again Elinor stopped him with a reproof."	"austen"
"They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations."	"austen"
"As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her mother, and sat down for that purpose."	"austen"
"She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her."	"austen"
"It was a horrid sight!yet when I thought of her to-day as really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last in this world."	"austen"
"Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of?"	"austen"
"Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him."	"austen"
"She must have a great deal to leave."	"austen"
"I should be sorry to have YOU ill; you, that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world!Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship."	"austen"
"Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as Holborn to-day."	"austen"
"You had rather take evil upon credit than good."	"austen"
"I wish with all my soul, cried Sir John, that Willoughby were among us again."	"austen"
"In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand."	"austen"
"Not in the stage, I assure you, replied Miss Steele, with quick exultation; we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to attend us."	"austen"
"She complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street."	"austen"
"To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present."	"austen"
"Excuse me, said she; and be assured that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings."	"austen"
"Yes, he replied gravely, once I have."	"austen"
"In short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings."	"austen"
"She avoided the looks of them all, could neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room."	"austen"
"after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter!"	"austen"
"You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,but this will give you no ideaI must go farther back."	"austen"
"Astonishment, that would have been as painful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it."	"austen"
"But Elinorhow are HER feelings to be described?From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, she was every thing by turns but tranquil."	"austen"
"His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as if fearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one."	"austen"
"I do not understand you, replied he, colouring."	"austen"
"My card was not lost, I hope."	"austen"
"(Laughing affectedly."	"austen"
"The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved."	"austen"
"Was she out with him today?"	"austen"
"She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have no moderation."	"austen"
"I do assure you that you owe it entirely, at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon's discernment of it."	"austen"
"But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it, he warmly replied; I did not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction; and common sense might have told her how to find it out."	"austen"
"Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?"	"austen"
"I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after all the troubles we have went through lately, therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed to say that, thank God!"	"austen"
"Elinor smiled, and shook her head."	"austen"
"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of them."	"austen"
"Of ONE thing, my dear sister, kindly taking her hand, and speaking in an awful whisper,I may assure you;and I WILL do it, because I know it must gratify you."	"austen"
"But while she wondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other."	"austen"
"Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no more meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her."	"austen"
"In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton's first letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey."	"austen"
"Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself to speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner, which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude May I ask if your engagement is of long standing?"	"austen"
"Such were my reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my wife's words, and parted with the last relics of Marianne."	"austen"
"You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor."	"austen"
"There was something in her style of beauty, to please them particularly."	"austen"
"I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff."	"austen"
"But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and love, you know, and all thatOh, la!"	"austen"
"I mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like forgiveness from Mafrom your sister."	"austen"
"Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his voice at that moment!"	"austen"
"The ivory, the gold, and the pearls, all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care, and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference."	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found attempting to rise from the bed, and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food; for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many nights since she had really slept; and now, when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous faintness."	"austen"
"She pausedand added in a low voice, If I could but know HIS heart, everything would become easy."	"austen"
"Ay, you may abuse me as you please, said the good-natured old lady, you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back again."	"austen"
"And who was this uncle?"	"austen"
"Well, and whose fault is that?"	"austen"
"says I, 'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?'"	"austen"
"I have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort."	"austen"
"Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival's, the reward of her sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby's death."	"austen"
"Ay, it is but too true."	"austen"
"Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray's shop."	"austen"
"Aye, aye, said Mrs. Jennings, we know the reason of all that very well; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you would not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited."	"austen"
"Why was it necessary to call?"	"austen"
"Betty's sister would never do for them NOW."	"austen"
"I have been expecting to hear from you, and still more to see you, every hour of the day."	"austen"
"Nor I, answered Marianne with energy, our situations then are alike."	"austen"
"But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence."	"austen"
"In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on the very different mind of a very different person, who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings's chariot, which she knew had not been ordered till one."	"austen"
"This was an affair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve."	"austen"
"Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy."	"austen"
"Her heart was not so much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure."	"austen"
"Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the house, her husband accidentally came out."	"austen"
"But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable!"	"austen"
"But, I confess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother."	"austen"
"Nay, more, I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage."	"austen"
"About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby was also arrived."	"austen"
"Marianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out."	"austen"
"What felt Elinor at that moment?"	"austen"
"But that was not enough; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from them."	"austen"
"I was repulsed indeed!"	"austen"
"Elinor for a few moments remained silent."	"austen"
"I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune."	"austen"
"She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses, her wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other."	"austen"
"Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother's tone, calmly replied, The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair."	"austen"
"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer."	"austen"
"It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name."	"austen"
"Marianne herself had seen less of his Mama the rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house."	"austen"
"I will not trust to THAT, retreating to her own room."	"austen"
"And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and then I hope she will not much mind it."	"austen"
"You are quite in the right, replied Elinor calmly."	"austen"
"You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could."	"austen"
"replied Elinor, why should you think so?"	"austen"
"I guessed how it would end."	"austen"
"Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have been telling you?Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours."	"austen"
"Marianne heard enough."	"austen"
"It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness."	"austen"
"Their man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and when, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntary communication I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married."	"austen"
"This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression."	"austen"
"Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in silence."	"austen"
"replied her cousin, with affected earnestness, and I beg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of."	"austen"
"There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight."	"austen"
"She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his measures."	"austen"
"What is the amount of his fortune?"	"austen"
"THAT I will never consent to."	"austen"
"And so YOU are forced to do it."	"austen"
"You had better leave me, was all the notice that her sister received from her."	"austen"
"Mr. Ferrars is to be the man."	"austen"
"She expects to be confined in February, continued Mrs. Jennings."	"austen"
"Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment."	"austen"
"But I see what you mean."	"austen"
"A woman of seven and twenty, said Marianne, after pausing a moment, can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the provision and security of a wife."	"austen"
"The mother's consternation was excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and every thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer."	"austen"
"Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who, always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure."	"austen"
"Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child."	"austen"
"All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life."	"austen"
"In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation."	"austen"
"Elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word."	"austen"
"But mama did not think the match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel, and we should have been married immediately."	"austen"
"Are you certain that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?"	"austen"
"I never saw such fine children in my life.I declare I quite doat upon them already, and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children."	"austen"
"I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear of our parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my duty required, urge him to it for prudence sake, and would have parted for ever on the spot, would he consent to it; but he said it should never be, he did not regard his mother's anger, while he could have my affections; our prospects are not very bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for the best; he will be ordained shortly; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow, am very sure you will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too, trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John, or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to assist us.Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did, but she did it for the best, so I say nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won't think it too much trouble to give us a call, should she come this way any morning, 'twould be a great kindness, and my cousins would be proud to know her.My paper reminds me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her, and to Sir John, and Lady Middleton, and the dear children, when you chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne, I am, &c. As soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to be its writer's real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise."	"austen"
"She began to think that he must be in liquor;the strangeness of such a visit, and of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this impression she immediately rose, saying, Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to CombeI am not at leisure to remain with you longer."	"austen"
"Take my word for it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan't go if Lucy an't there."	"austen"
"Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening."	"austen"
"On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better."	"austen"
"She saw it with concern; for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty?"	"austen"
"The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her ignorance of the worldevery thing was against me."	"austen"
"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward, she cried."	"austen"
"After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings, with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again."	"austen"
"But why should not I wear pink ribbons?"	"austen"
"Upon my soul, said he, I do not know much about him as to all THAT."	"austen"
"Had he been in his right senses, he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child."	"austen"
"Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid of her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her, as they must live together."	"austen"
"More than you think it really and intrinsically worth."	"austen"
"Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey of the guest."	"austen"
"I called her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her."	"austen"
"And you will never see me otherwise."	"austen"
"She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every morning."	"austen"
"Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know."	"austen"
"Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate friend."	"austen"
"Elinor felt equal amazement."	"austen"
"But then again, the dread of having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over her, for she presently added, Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton's style of painting, Ma'am?She DOES paint most delightfully!How beautifully her last landscape is done!"	"austen"
"They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now, said Elinor, by these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago."	"austen"
"And who knows but you may raise a dance, said she."	"austen"
"But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits."	"austen"
"But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which at least satisfied herself."	"austen"
"She was well paid for her impudence."	"austen"
"Don't we all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met?"	"austen"
"one never thinks of married men's being beauxthey have something else to do."	"austen"
"It is only the Palmers."	"austen"
"She sighed for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if any place could give her ease, Barton must do it."	"austen"
"This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;and it has not been only once;I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again."	"austen"
"This argument was irresistible."	"austen"
"But why should you dislike him?"	"austen"
"Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the tablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed."	"austen"
"He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in particular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word."	"austen"
"You may believe how glad we all were to see them, added Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on different sides of the room; but, however, I can't help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it, for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for you know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation."	"austen"
"What else can detain him at Norland?"	"austen"
"Why they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion."	"austen"
"Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and the conversation could be continued no farther."	"austen"
"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday, and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home."	"austen"
"On HER measures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel Brandon was soon brought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there as equally determinate, if not equally indispensable."	"austen"
"Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?"	"austen"
"CHAPTER 41 Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with his happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett's Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings, who called on her again the next day with her congratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life."	"austen"
"Your mother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent."	"austen"
"But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both."	"austen"
"Perhaps, Miss Marianne, cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on her, you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have no mind to keep them, little as well as great."	"austen"
"Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother, rather than her own, whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured her, and with great sincerity, that she did pity herto the utter amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor."	"austen"
"You must not talk so, Marianne."	"austen"
"'THERE, to be sure,' said she, 'I might have thought myself safe.'"	"austen"
"I thank you, ma'am, sincerely thank you, said Marianne, with warmth: your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of, to be able to accept it."	"austen"
"They reached town by three o'clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey, from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire."	"austen"
"It seems but the work of a moment."	"austen"
"And I protest, if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself down at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy."	"austen"
"This set the matter beyond a doubt."	"austen"
"Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more."	"austen"
"He must enter into all my feelings; the same books, the same music must charm us both."	"austen"
"In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself."	"austen"
"I do not want to pry into other men's concerns."	"austen"
"In my heart I feel littlescarcely any doubt of his preference."	"austen"
"We were last night at Lady Middleton's, where there was a dance."	"austen"
"My judgment, he returned, is all on your side of the question; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister's."	"austen"
"The prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income, besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity."	"austen"
"The business of self-command she settled very easily;with strong affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit."	"austen"
"replied her mother with a smile."	"austen"
"Mind me, now, if they an't married by Mid-summer."	"austen"
"Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty."	"austen"
"I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here STILL, said she repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word."	"austen"
"But it would have broke MY heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility."	"austen"
"He had not the power of accepting it."	"austen"
"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose."	"austen"
"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister, said John, as they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford House, THAT would be saying too much, for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is."	"austen"
"And the dried cherries too!"	"austen"
"I shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity."	"austen"
"She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned."	"austen"
"No, I do not think we shall."	"austen"
"But I will not suppose this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise."	"austen"
"The private balls at the park then began; and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow."	"austen"
"It was lower and quicker than ever!"	"austen"
"Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished."	"austen"
"Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would despise her for offering."	"austen"
"She thanked him with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines to her mother."	"austen"
"Elinor blushed in spite of herself."	"austen"
"The remaining five were now to draw their cards."	"austen"
"Yes, ma'am, she said how she was very well; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young ladyand she seemed vastly contented."	"austen"
"Then continuing his former tone, he said, And yet this house you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?"	"austen"
"It was an advantage that could not be too gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits, was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days' time."	"austen"
"Where is the green-house to be?"	"austen"
"However it may have come about, said Elinor, after a pause,they are certainly married."	"austen"
"He entered the room with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it as long as he staid."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 14 The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with his steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance."	"austen"
"In spite of the improvements and additions which were making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;no poverty of any kind, except of conversation, appearedbut there, the deficiency was considerable."	"austen"
"Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister."	"austen"
"I wishI heartily wish it had never been."	"austen"
"It would be enough to make them completely easy."	"austen"
"You have no confidence in me, Marianne."	"austen"
"Such as it is, however, my pleasure in presenting it to him, will be very great."	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;and Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope."	"austen"
"I do not like ruined, tattered cottages."	"austen"
"Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas."	"austen"
"He repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness."	"austen"
"She begged him to think again on the subject."	"austen"
"Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible."	"austen"
"But she must not go round by London, cried Marianne, in the same hurried manner."	"austen"
"Tell me what it is, explain the grounds on which you acted, and I shall be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you."	"austen"
"Elinor, I must go home."	"austen"
"About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting by herself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful; and giving her time only to form that idea, began directly to justify it, by saying, Lord!"	"austen"
"Their own good-nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my dear madam will easily believe."	"austen"
"He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and ushered her in himself."	"austen"
"said Elinor, reproachfully; a note would have answered every purpose."	"austen"
"My business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance."	"austen"
"Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy and rich."	"austen"
"Her three notesunluckily they were all in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence, and hoarded them for everI was forced to put them up, and could not even kiss them."	"austen"
"Elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand."	"austen"
"Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own voice, now said, Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?"	"austen"
"But, as it was, she only learned, from some very significant looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret's instructions, extended."	"austen"
"Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Marianne was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret, for you are a party concerned."	"austen"
"repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught those words by a sudden pause in Marianne's music."	"austen"
"She dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower."	"austen"
"Whereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and treating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration, which a conscientious woman would not disregard."	"austen"
"The old well-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child, was the cause of all."	"austen"
"But the letter, when she was calm enough to read it, brought little comfort."	"austen"
"He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties."	"austen"
"He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment."	"austen"
"I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma'am, this morning in Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Steele as was."	"austen"
"I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer's, where I have been dining."	"austen"
"Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, Miss Morton is Lord Morton's daughter."	"austen"
"A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table."	"austen"
"Short was the time, however, in which that fear could affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby's leaving the house, she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage.Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment's horrible suspense, she ran immediately into the hall, and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it."	"austen"
"Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her countenance betrayed her interest in what was said."	"austen"
"Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper; but she was saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy's sharp reprimand, which now, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness to the manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of the other."	"austen"
"said Marianne to herself as she walked on."	"austen"
"But however, all that is quite out of the questionnot to be thought of or mentionedas to any attachment you knowit never could beall that is gone by."	"austen"
"I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life!"	"austen"
"But at the same time, she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself."	"austen"
"I am sorry I did not know it before; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself."	"austen"
"This is very unfortunate."	"austen"
"Had he married a more amiable woman, he might have been made still more respectable than he was:he might even have been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and very fond of his wife."	"austen"
"There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments, conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude was produced."	"austen"
"You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement!"	"austen"
"In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases at Gray's."	"austen"
"You reside in Devonshire, I think,was his next observation, in a cottage near Dawlish."	"austen"
"Yet, though smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it."	"austen"
"Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and be happy with him."	"austen"
"Her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance."	"austen"
"he exclaimedImprove this dear cottage!"	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby's groom; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house."	"austen"
"The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away."	"austen"
"I remember her perfectly."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 38 Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward's conduct, but only Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit."	"austen"
"Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a kindIt is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what SHE was, that my heart should have been so insensible!"	"austen"
"Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely."	"austen"
"She does not deserve your compassion.She knew I had no regard for her when we married.Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be happy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay.And now do you pity me, Miss Dashwood?or have I said all this to no purpose?"	"austen"
"Perhaps, said Elinor, smiling, we may come to the same point."	"austen"
"What had really passed between them was to this effect."	"austen"
"I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be."	"austen"
"But I thought it was right, Elinor, said Marianne, to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people."	"austen"
"They were to go immediately to Delaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home, and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it; and from thence, after staying there a couple of nights, he was to proceed on his journey to town."	"austen"
"They each felt his sorrows, and their own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the reward of all."	"austen"
"I know we shall be happy."	"austen"
"Had I died,it would have been self-destruction."	"austen"
"Mr. Palmer took no notice of her."	"austen"
"I suppose your brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was so rich?"	"austen"
"I was at Norland about a month ago."	"austen"
"And I must say, I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit."	"austen"
"But if she DID, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact."	"austen"
"He is always out of humour."	"austen"
"Nothing can be like it, to be sure!"	"austen"
"She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes of Lucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her."	"austen"
"I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from Willoughby."	"austen"
"It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby."	"austen"
"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's."	"austen"
"Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne's letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed, and entreat her directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into the drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen, grieving over her for the hardship of such a task, and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother."	"austen"
"To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and plantations."	"austen"
"It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it, I assure you."	"austen"
"I would not wish to do any thing mean, he replied."	"austen"
"Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper."	"austen"
"It was told me,it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph."	"austen"
"Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation?"	"austen"
"He dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings for fear of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to be told, they could do nothing at present but write."	"austen"
"To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking, considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was persuaded by Elinor to stay at home."	"austen"
"But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;and her business will not detain you from us long I hope."	"austen"
"But in this, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling."	"austen"
"There now; you see how droll he is."	"austen"
"Not so the Miss Steeles.They came from Exeter, well provided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his relations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant, accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted."	"austen"
"Don't you, Mr. Palmer?"	"austen"
"he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience."	"austen"
"His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters."	"austen"
"I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with him."	"austen"
"The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book, in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off together."	"austen"
"He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained a smile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment."	"austen"
"For the present, adieu."	"austen"
"The event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded on injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon DID come in; and Elinor, who was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look, and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her, could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly."	"austen"
"I wished very much to call upon you yesterday, said he, but it was impossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars."	"austen"
"With almost every other man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect; but Edward's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know."	"austen"
"I am glad, said Lady Middleton to Lucy, you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria's basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight."	"austen"
"They will soon be back again, and then they'd be sure and call here."	"austen"
"Had both the children been there, the affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was present, it was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it over and over again as often as they liked."	"austen"
"Not a soul suspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!"	"austen"
"Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if concealment be possible, is all that remains."	"austen"
"As to that, said he, I must rub through the world as well as I can."	"austen"
"Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all."	"austen"
"She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing."	"austen"
"No, said he, I never said any thing so irrational."	"austen"
"The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected back."	"austen"
"To be sure, your brother and sister will ask you to come to them."	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself; and positively refusing Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone for the rest of the morning."	"austen"
"She came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled when she went away."	"austen"
"The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings's style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind."	"austen"
"Absence might have weakened his regard, and convenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt."	"austen"
"The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks longer unpardoned."	"austen"
"She gave him a brief reply."	"austen"
"She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations."	"austen"
"They afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than ever."	"austen"
"A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection."	"austen"
"In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, as far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance."	"austen"
"He is the most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish, of any body I ever saw."	"austen"
"Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion."	"austen"
"Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other, that she wept with agony through the whole of it."	"austen"
"In this situation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first perceived her; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness, Marianne, may I ask-?"	"austen"
"Nay, Edward, said Marianne, you need not reproach me."	"austen"
"The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now hoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, to prevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before."	"austen"
"Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back towards them."	"austen"
"Oh, dear, that is a great pity!"	"austen"
"Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?"	"austen"
"The tenderest caresses followed this confession."	"austen"
"I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature."	"austen"
"Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?"	"austen"
"Two ladies were waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all."	"austen"
"My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her attachment to meit was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased."	"austen"
"It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation."	"austen"
"Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity."	"austen"
"Well may you wonder, Marianne, replied her brother, at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these."	"austen"
"When Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming, were put into execution."	"austen"
"Well, sir, said Mrs. Jennings, and how did it end?"	"austen"
"Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have liked it of all things."	"austen"
"Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer."	"austen"
"She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them."	"austen"
"And his person, his manners too, are all in his favour."	"austen"
"Elinor made what excuse she could for her."	"austen"
"I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD."	"austen"
"It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest allusion to what has passed, before my sister."	"austen"
"Miss Dashwooda subject such as thisuntouched for fourteen yearsit is dangerous to handle it at all!"	"austen"
"Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time?"	"austen"
"Their housekeeping will be nothing at all."	"austen"
"Few people of common prudence will do THAT; and whatever she saves, she will be able to dispose of."	"austen"
"It is very true, said Marianne, that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon."	"austen"
"He could only obtain a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in amazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the Miss Steeles to them."	"austen"
"Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success."	"austen"
"He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection."	"austen"
"A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded."	"austen"
"I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again; so I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to receive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour, attended by Sir John."	"austen"
"And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother's Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him."	"austen"
"Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him."	"austen"
"My feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision; I wish to acquit you, but certainty on either side will be ease to what I now suffer."	"austen"
"Grandeur has but little, said Elinor, but wealth has much to do with it."	"austen"
"Willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities were strong."	"austen"
"I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest."	"austen"
"In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over."	"austen"
"But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thing to say about that?"	"austen"
"But I shall see them tomorrow."	"austen"
"Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the deviation is necessary."	"austen"
"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?"	"austen"
"By whom can you have heard it mentioned?"	"austen"
"This woman of whom he writeswhoever she beor any one, in short, but your own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me."	"austen"
"The manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for it struck her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion of that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage.But her curiosity was unavailing, for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by Miss Steele when alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir John."	"austen"
"I felt sure that you was angry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs."	"austen"
"It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well."	"austen"
"But (with a smile) you would be materially benefited in one particular at leastyou would know where to go when you left them."	"austen"
"Not that you have any reason to regret, my dear Elinor."	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings received the information with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness and care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her."	"austen"
"I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill-bred."	"austen"
"Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?"	"austen"
"However, I got a very good husband, and I don't know what the greatest beauty can do more."	"austen"
"I have thought it all over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you."	"austen"
"Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive."	"austen"
"The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness."	"austen"
"Sit down, and I will be both."	"austen"
"Edward was the first to speak, and it was to notice Marianne's altered looks, and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her."	"austen"
"Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age."	"austen"
"But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being."	"austen"
"She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister."	"austen"
"He was nice in his eating, uncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to slight it; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been devoted to business."	"austen"
"I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 39 The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town, and Marianne's impatience to be gone increased every day."	"austen"
"Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and therefore never came near her, they received no mark of recognition on their entrance."	"austen"
"If, however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther, I must think very differently of him from what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present."	"austen"
"The son, a steady respectable young man, was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large, and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age."	"austen"
"She had seen enough of her pride, her meanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise free;and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars's creation, preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion."	"austen"
"His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or could oblige herself to speak to him."	"austen"
"The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run the risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman, whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike."	"austen"
"'But how can it be done?'"	"austen"
"I understand you, he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice perfectly calm; yes, I am very drunk."	"austen"
"Yes, a littlenot much."	"austen"
"They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations and friends."	"austen"
"When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call; and as she had no business at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her young friends transacted their's, she should pay her visit and return for them."	"austen"
"Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay."	"austen"
"Precious as was the company of her daughter to her, she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor."	"austen"
"Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate."	"austen"
"But the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness."	"austen"
"The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says, she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad."	"austen"
"Every thing he said, was clever."	"austen"
"Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband's family; but she had had no opportunity, till the present, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it."	"austen"
"I shall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, and we will plan our improvements accordingly."	"austen"
"Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks."	"austen"
"To suffer you all to be so deceived; to see your sisterbut what could I do?"	"austen"
"I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct."	"austen"
"Their presence always gave her pain, and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her STILL in town."	"austen"
"She read nothing but what they had been used to read together."	"austen"
"Where did you hear it?"	"austen"
"Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself?"	"austen"
"He had left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor relieved her."	"austen"
"cried Lucy, who generally made an amendment to all her sister's assertions."	"austen"
"He wished him at the devil with all his heart."	"austen"
"Marianne, cried her sister, how can you say so?"	"austen"
"You surprise me very much."	"austen"
"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future."	"austen"
"She got up to examine them."	"austen"
"Should not you, Mr. Palmer?"	"austen"
"Their mother had nothing, and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest in it."	"austen"
"Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother, might not have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her table; but as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy, who had long wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties, and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her life, than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card."	"austen"
"There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by believing or calling it more than it is."	"austen"
"When Edward's unhappy match takes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible."	"austen"
"Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to her, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening's engagement, though without expecting the smallest amusement from any, and very often without knowing, till the last moment, where it was to take her."	"austen"
"When I got to Mr. Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child."	"austen"
"But to appear happy when I am so miserableOh!"	"austen"
"Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome."	"austen"
"Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at others, lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him."	"austen"
"Well, sir, said Elinor, who, though pitying him, grew impatient for his departure, and this is all?"	"austen"
"To her own heart it was a delightful affair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle."	"austen"
"How came they acquainted?"	"austen"
"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income."	"austen"
"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother, added Elinor; and once or twice I have attempted it;but without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced you."	"austen"
"The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less."	"austen"
"'It would have been beyond comparison,' she said, 'the least evil of the two, and she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse.'"	"austen"
"Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do."	"austen"
"Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired."	"austen"
"Here, however, Elinor perceived,not the language, not the professions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her mother's active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose."	"austen"
"In the society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent."	"austen"
"nothing seems to do her any good."	"austen"
"I was very unwilling to enter into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so prudent as I ought to have been."	"austen"
"There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding."	"austen"
"A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge one."	"austen"
"But Sir John's satisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier they were the better was he pleased."	"austen"
"The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from Lucy herself."	"austen"
"why does he not look at me?"	"austen"
"In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was invited to play."	"austen"
"By reading only six hours a-day, I shall gain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want."	"austen"
"She must be attached to you, or she would not have married you."	"austen"
"Wait only till tomorrow."	"austen"
"Certainly, ma'am, replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said, and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject."	"austen"
"And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason."	"austen"
"My dear friend, cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, I come to talk to you of my happiness."	"austen"
"As my mother-in-law's relations, I shall be happy to show them every respect."	"austen"
"Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him half so much."	"austen"
"She had raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand."	"austen"
"I never saw anything so charming!"	"austen"
"Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doingwhat she may drive her son to."	"austen"
"Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell me, what is the matter?"	"austen"
"The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor of their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the event."	"austen"
"But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy goes to it."	"austen"
"We measured the dining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan."	"austen"
"Elinor could not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward."	"austen"
"On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire."	"austen"
"Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears."	"austen"
"And now to be so rewarded!"	"austen"
"The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own."	"austen"
"Had you any idea of his coming so soon?"	"austen"
"Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach of her own party made another more necessary."	"austen"
"It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world."	"austen"
"She would have given the world to be able to speakand to make them understand that she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour to him;but she had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion."	"austen"
"I do not like crooked, twisted, blasted trees."	"austen"
"We shall miss her; but SHE will be happy."	"austen"
"The sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and thank Heaven!"	"austen"
"He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections."	"austen"
"In that, he could not be defended; but if he had injured her, how much more had he injured himself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless."	"austen"
"She repeated it to Edward."	"austen"
"I care not who knows that I am wretched."	"austen"
"The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother."	"austen"
"Could not she see that we wanted her gone!how teazing to Edward!"	"austen"
"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood, said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister."	"austen"
"John Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing, and his wife had still less."	"austen"
"But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his only one twelvemonth."	"austen"
"Elinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home; and till they reached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could be safely indulged."	"austen"
"Colonel, said she, with her usual noisy cheerfulness, I am monstrous glad to see yousorry I could not come beforebeg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have been at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!"	"austen"
"But why should you think, said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister, that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex?"	"austen"
"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility, said Edward to Elinor."	"austen"
"She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand, unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister's, and tears covered her cheeks."	"austen"
"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?"	"austen"
"She is a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; a very near relation."	"austen"
"Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in their face."	"austen"
"You had made your own choice."	"austen"
"I assure you they are very genteel people."	"austen"
"Others even arose to confirm it."	"austen"
"It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton."	"austen"
"The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his favourite pointer at her feet."	"austen"
"She was previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention, the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my present visit."	"austen"
"cried Marianne, with strong surprise."	"austen"
"His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after he left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game."	"austen"
"In Bond Street especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in constant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all that interested and occupied the others."	"austen"
"His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions."	"austen"
"I never was in better health."	"austen"
"Only think of their coming so suddenly!"	"austen"
"I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret, in the end he must become so."	"austen"
"He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England!"	"austen"
"With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness."	"austen"
"Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her."	"austen"
"Elinor would not contend, and only replied, Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph, my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits."	"austen"
"You have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely deceived, in something concerning me, which may have lowered me in your opinion."	"austen"
"The work of one moment was destroyed by the next."	"austen"
"The original was all her ownher own happy thoughts and gentle diction."	"austen"
"They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the others went on the downs."	"austen"
"Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while attempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse."	"austen"
"Marianne might at that moment be dying."	"austen"
"Mr. Edward Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends."	"austen"
"In such a case, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general character;but I will not raise objections against any one's conduct on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent."	"austen"
"It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them."	"austen"
"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its subject."	"austen"
"She was sure it was very illit cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples."	"austen"
"And that I fancy, will be the end of it."	"austen"
"And as to the house being a bad one, I do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as ever I saw."	"austen"
"But you shall hear it all."	"austen"
"How can that be done?"	"austen"
"They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cutand he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;and from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was adopted."	"austen"
"How cold, how composed were their last adieus!"	"austen"
"Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much."	"austen"
"In such a frame of mind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness;to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her;and even to see Edward himself, if chance should bring them together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality."	"austen"
"And how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess is beyond my comprehension."	"austen"
"He agreed that he might."	"austen"
"Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise."	"austen"
"Certainlyand I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a-piece."	"austen"
"I will have you BOTH go, said Mrs. Dashwood; these objections are nonsensical."	"austen"
"How much may not a few months do?"	"austen"
"I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands."	"austen"
"You had better come earlier another time, because we are generally out by one."	"austen"
"I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature."	"austen"
"I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her."	"austen"
"On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their visitor, towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute, he wished to engage them for both."	"austen"
"She was awake the whole night, and she wept the greatest part of it."	"austen"
"Elinor could sit it no longer."	"austen"
"This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister's establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there."	"austen"
"But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers."	"austen"
"For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood!"	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its healing powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister."	"austen"
"replied Lucy; I wonder at that, for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes."	"austen"
"It came out quite unawares, quite undesignedly."	"austen"
"My love, have you been asleep?"	"austen"
"Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars's way of treating me yesterday?"	"austen"
"It was not so yesterday, I think."	"austen"
"She spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her voice often totally suspended by her tears."	"austen"
"They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation."	"austen"
"she looks very unwell, has lost her colour, and is grown quite thin."	"austen"
"He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest."	"austen"
"He left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do not know; for WE of course can make no inquiry."	"austen"
"As for the house itself, to be sure, said she, it is too small for our family, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late in the year for improvements."	"austen"
"And what, said Mrs. Dashwood, is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest?"	"austen"
"When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as they were all got together, they must do something by way of being happy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country."	"austen"
"I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day Miss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison could never agree."	"austen"
"Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy."	"austen"
"Has he a house at Allenham?"	"austen"
"The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens, though it was only the second week in March."	"austen"
"He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general direct him perfectly right."	"austen"
"His imprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise."	"austen"
"A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, to make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit."	"austen"
"The honour was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain."	"austen"
"I always pity them when they do; they seem to take it so much to heart."	"austen"
"The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her sister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change of posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness, cried out, Is mama coming?"	"austen"
"Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world."	"austen"
"But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him."	"austen"
"Her sensibility was potent enough!"	"austen"
"He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose."	"austen"
"Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, and very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with."	"austen"
"He saw her concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect."	"austen"
"This seems to have been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to us."	"austen"
"Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising."	"austen"
"Of Elinor's distress, she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; and calmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said, Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life!"	"austen"
"This decided the matter at once."	"austen"
"Scarcely a word was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street."	"austen"
"The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever."	"austen"
"But farther than this you must not believe."	"austen"
"and as she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished him indifferent."	"austen"
"I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better."	"austen"
"You have proved your heart less wicked, much less wicked."	"austen"
"continued Mrs. Palmerthen it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose."	"austen"
"Rather say your mother's imprudence, my child, said Mrs. Dashwood; SHE must be answerable."	"austen"
"You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?"	"austen"
"But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert, and the idea of that, for Edward's sake, frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures."	"austen"
"I go to Oxford tomorrow."	"austen"
"You, Miss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent youand as for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough in London to content her."	"austen"
"But Marianne seemed hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings's entrance, escaped with the precious card."	"austen"
"She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some surprise to be her brother."	"austen"
"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist."	"austen"
"Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise."	"austen"
"As for Colonel Brandon, she was not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and scarcely resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she possibly could, of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his poultry."	"austen"
"It was no time for hesitation."	"austen"
"That was just like Lucy.Poor soul!"	"austen"
"They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy."	"austen"
"But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world."	"austen"
"Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma'am, said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; and I do not much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever heard."	"austen"
"I can hardly tell myself."	"austen"
"You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper."	"austen"
"I have had no hand in it."	"austen"
"In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful."	"austen"
"worse than cold-hearted!"	"austen"
"And how does dear, dear Norland look?"	"austen"
"I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected."	"austen"
"The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton!"	"austen"
"And the lock of hairthat too I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book, which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,the dear lockall, every memento was torn from me."	"austen"
"Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in readiness; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you."	"austen"
"Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters."	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said."	"austen"
"A proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less."	"austen"
"She is only grown a little more grave than she was."	"austen"
"I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men, you may depend upon it."	"austen"
"Poor fellow!I am afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes in wretched spirits."	"austen"
"Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased."	"austen"
"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no addition at all."	"austen"
"You forget, said Elinor gently, that its situation is not...that it is not in the neighbourhood of..."	"austen"
"said Mrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter's reproof."	"austen"
"No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before she set off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her, was soon done.The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter."	"austen"
"She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room, by asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively."	"austen"
"Hers, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate."	"austen"
"Nothing but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it."	"austen"
"Our situations have borne little resemblance."	"austen"
"The party, like other musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all; and the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation, and that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in England."	"austen"
"His marriage must still be a distant good;at least, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon."	"austen"
"To know that Marianne was in town wasin the same languagea thunderbolt.Thunderbolts and daggers!what a reproof would she have given me!her taste, her opinionsI believe they are better known to me than my own,and I am sure they are dearer."	"austen"
"We consulted together, however, as to what should be done, and at last she determined to send for Edward."	"austen"
"The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent."	"austen"
"She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are as good friends as ever."	"austen"
"But by an appeal to her affection for her mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly subdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next, that it must be declined."	"austen"
"Much as you suffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later periodif your engagement had been carried on for months and months, as it might have been, before he chose to put an end to it."	"austen"
"You will tell me, I know, that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this."	"austen"
"Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture."	"austen"
"It raises my influence much too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person."	"austen"
"said Mrs. Dashwood, when he was leaving them."	"austen"
"When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning."	"austen"
"They settled in town, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy, in which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together."	"austen"
"As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger."	"austen"
"He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him."	"austen"
"He asked me to a party, a dance at his house in the evening.Had he NOT told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should have felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him."	"austen"
"and this was the end of it!"	"austen"
"You shall share its use with me."	"austen"
"Your ideas are only more noble than mine."	"austen"
"He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable."	"austen"
"When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared."	"austen"
"To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, as not to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her toilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of their being together, when it was finished."	"austen"
"she exclaimed, he is therehe is thereOh!"	"austen"
"She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say, and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 26 Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and beginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest, without wondering at her own situation, so short had their acquaintance with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition, and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before!"	"austen"
"I know where you spent the morning."	"austen"
"She pausedno one spoke."	"austen"
"No, answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitated feelings, on such a subject I certainly will not."	"austen"
"Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably dividing Elinor from her sister, he put an end to his visit, receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him."	"austen"
"They quitted it only with the removal of the tea-things."	"austen"
"Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it."	"austen"
"Had you married, you must have been always poor."	"austen"
"I shall keep it only till you can claim it."	"austen"
"But then you know, how should I guess such a thing?"	"austen"
"I was last month at my friend Elliott's, near Dartford."	"austen"
"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other."	"austen"
"What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest objection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had been given with Fanny."	"austen"
"He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but without satisfying her in any."	"austen"
"After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying, Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment?"	"austen"
"The cold insolence of Mrs. Ferrars's general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister's chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to hers, said in a low, but eager, voice, Dear, dear Elinor, don't mind them."	"austen"
"Good bye,God bless you!"	"austen"
"The connection was certainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration among her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single."	"austen"
"Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which it was given, obliged him to submit to her authority."	"austen"
"How I should like such a house for myself!"	"austen"
"No, indeed, it is not."	"austen"
"Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward."	"austen"
"As she said this, she looked directly at her companion."	"austen"
"But indeed you must and shall come."	"austen"
"You may see the end of the house."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 10 Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries."	"austen"
"But when this passed away, when her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he was passionately fond, she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay."	"austen"
"None at all, ma'am, I thank you."	"austen"
"You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's kindness is."	"austen"
"But I always thought I SHOULD."	"austen"
"As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window."	"austen"
"The whole family perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents."	"austen"
"The morning that we parted too!"	"austen"
"Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn."	"austen"
"But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up."	"austen"
"His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this plan."	"austen"
"she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing her before."	"austen"
"Marianne seemed much struck."	"austen"
"Elinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over the contents of all."	"austen"
"And I must say this: that you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we very well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM."	"austen"
"Am I reserved, Marianne?"	"austen"
"While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!such a suspicion could never have entered her head!"	"austen"
"But as they drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness."	"austen"
"The next morning brought another short note from Mariannestill affectionate, open, artless, confidingeverything that could make MY conduct most hateful."	"austen"
"And Sir John too, cried the elder sister, what a charming man he is!"	"austen"
"A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude."	"austen"
"And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle's care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary."	"austen"
"It is strange, replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, that I should never have heard him even mention your name."	"austen"
"She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all over the grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it; but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking."	"austen"
"I have had such a time of it!"	"austen"
"One question after this only remained undecided, between them, one difficulty only was to be overcome."	"austen"
"His medicines had failed;the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more quietnot more herselfremained in a heavy stupor."	"austen"
"Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections."	"austen"
"And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters, than to us?"	"austen"
"CHAPTER 42 One other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received her brother's congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton without any expense, and on Colonel Brandon's being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters in town;and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all things was the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less public, assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he should come to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting in the country."	"austen"
"Very welland for the next presentation to a living of that valuesupposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and likely to vacate it soonhe might have got I dare sayfourteen hundred pounds."	"austen"
"Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it."	"austen"
"At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter."	"austen"
"We must wait, it may be for many years."	"austen"
"I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you, said Elinor."	"austen"
"And here is my sweet little Annamaria, she added, tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the last two minutes; And she is always so gentle and quietNever was there such a quiet little thing!"	"austen"
"His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors confessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four."	"austen"
"She is an excellent housemaid, and works very well at her needle."	"austen"
"Your own judgment must direct you."	"austen"
"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor, said she, as she sat down to work, and with how heavy a heart does he travel?"	"austen"
"What is the gentleman's name?"	"austen"
"You and I, Sir John, said Mrs. Jennings, should not stand upon such ceremony."	"austen"
"But though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its influence on her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself."	"austen"
"For my part, I think the less that is said about such things, the better, the sooner 'tis blown over and forgot."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 21 The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain each other."	"austen"
"Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others."	"austen"
"We all wish her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout the whole, has been such as every conscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt."	"austen"
"Nor could she leave the place in which Willoughby remained, busy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which SHE could have no share, without shedding many tears."	"austen"
"But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all."	"austen"
"In a few months, my dear Marianne."	"austen"
"Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, she could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure a disappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire."	"austen"
"Every circumstance belonging to him was interesting."	"austen"
"We may treat it as a joke, said he, at last, recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the momentbut, upon my soul, it is a most serious business."	"austen"
"it is very fatiguing to him!"	"austen"
"Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended thus."	"austen"
"But can we wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should fall?"	"austen"
"There seems to me a very decided difference."	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings soon came in."	"austen"
"She played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied."	"austen"
"And your brother and sister were not very kind!"	"austen"
"The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms."	"austen"
"She knows her own worth too well for false shame, replied Edward."	"austen"
"Believe me, and Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity, nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea."	"austen"
"The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill."	"austen"
"Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;he took it, looked at the direction, changed colour, and immediately left the room."	"austen"
"He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect."	"austen"
"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not."	"austen"
"She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry."	"austen"
"The alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown tedious and dull."	"austen"
"In feeling, in action, in condition, in every thing."	"austen"
"how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it!"	"austen"
"He seems an excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing."	"austen"
"His spirits, during the last two or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improvedhe grew more and more partial to the house and environsnever spoke of going away without a sighdeclared his time to be wholly disengagedeven doubted to what place he should go when he left thembut still, go he must."	"austen"
"All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long."	"austen"
"To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and answering Elinor's letter would be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than Elinor's."	"austen"
"But I have injured more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for me(may I say it?)"	"austen"
"She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she supposed her young friend's affliction could be increased by noise."	"austen"
"She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give her hand to another!and THAT other, a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years before, she had considered too old to be married,and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!"	"austen"
"The first question on her side, which led to farther particulars, was, How long has this been known to you, Elinor?"	"austen"
"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?"	"austen"
"Elinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sister's behaviour."	"austen"
"They come straight from town, as Miss LucyMrs."	"austen"
"Careless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any design of returning her affection."	"austen"
"Your brother has gained my affections entirely, and as we could not live without one another, we are just returned from the altar, and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see, but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines, and shall always remain, Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister, LUCY FERRARS."	"austen"
"He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own."	"austen"
"From you, her mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence."	"austen"
"I believe I have been wrong in saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence."	"austen"
"They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 27 If this open weather holds much longer, said Mrs. Jennings, when they met at breakfast the following morning, Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week; 'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day's pleasure."	"austen"
"Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood."	"austen"
"And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward, cried not as I did."	"austen"
"From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, or any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discover it by accident."	"austen"
"About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it."	"austen"
"The shock which her marriage had given me, he continued, in a voice of great agitation, was of trifling weightwas nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years afterwards, of her divorce."	"austen"
"Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at all nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as reflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself leading to the fact."	"austen"
"Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching Marianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it, and THAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several minutes on the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude, before she went to her sister."	"austen"
"It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she immediately left the room."	"austen"
"Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her sister's health were more secure, before she appointed it."	"austen"
"He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to marry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh."	"austen"
"His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition!and his woods!I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger!And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract himyet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may happenfor, when people are much thrown together, and see little of anybody elseand it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage, and so forth;in short, you may as well give her a chanceYou understand me."	"austen"
"Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round, while Sir John's independent employments were in existence only half the time."	"austen"
"Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son;but to his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods."	"austen"
"I am perfectly satisfied of both."	"austen"
"I should scold her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend."	"austen"
"What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!"	"austen"
"CHAPTER 19 Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height."	"austen"
"But have I ever known it?Well may it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to avarice?or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?"	"austen"
"One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than too little."	"austen"
"We are never safe from HIM."	"austen"
"His own merits must soon secure it."	"austen"
"He looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying with some friends near Plymouth."	"austen"
"Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his accountshe cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him."	"austen"
"Well, my dear, she cried, I sent you up the young man."	"austen"
"He looked surprised and said, I beg your pardon, I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally talked of."	"austen"
"She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor's representation of herself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness, suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne."	"austen"
"His name was good, his residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming."	"austen"
"No, ma'amthe horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any longer; I was afraid of being late."	"austen"
"What can bring her here so often?"	"austen"
"The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further intelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival, that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away, as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection."	"austen"
"Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise her self-importance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars."	"austen"
"He has told me so himself."	"austen"
"Her daughter did not look, however, as if much of it were heard by her."	"austen"
"But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he stepped over directly, and as soon as ever Mama, he said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy."	"austen"
"However, I don't think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure, though we could not get him to own it last night."	"austen"
"This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country."	"austen"
"Elinor DID think the question a very odd one, and her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars."	"austen"
"Do let me hear a word about the expense of it."	"austen"
"And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much the other day."	"austen"
"Nay, my dear, I'm sure I don't pretend to say that there an't."	"austen"
"What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters, even if REALLY his sisters!"	"austen"
"The power of disappointing them, it was true, must always be hers."	"austen"
"I would not ask such a question for the world."	"austen"
"In defence of your protege you can even be saucy."	"austen"
"But no, she would go down; she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less."	"austen"
"If I were you, whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely."	"austen"
"for of course you must know, as you have been in Devonshire so lately.'"	"austen"
"I remember her aunt very well, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man."	"austen"
"You will be delighted with them I am sure."	"austen"
"The smallness of the house, said she, I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family and income."	"austen"
"Anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock;when his assurances, his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy."	"austen"
"Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to go on."	"austen"
"To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while?"	"austen"
"But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be made less happy, less comfortable by our absenceOh!"	"austen"
"Your poor mother, too!doting on Marianne."	"austen"
"what a delightful room this is!"	"austen"
"There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly wellquite as well, or better, perhaps, all things considered."	"austen"
"Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into her chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, tried to screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her with lavender water."	"austen"
"It will be quite delightful!My love, applying to her husband, don't you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?"	"austen"
"It should not, must not be a struggle."	"austen"
"It would be impossible, I know, replied Elinor, to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her."	"austen"
"I would suppose him,Oh, how gladly would I suppose him, only fickle, very, very fickle."	"austen"
"Elinor's happiness was not so great."	"austen"
"Fifty thousand pounds!"	"austen"
"It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable, that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality."	"austen"
"They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood."	"austen"
"When is she dejected or melancholy?"	"austen"
"I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from our different situations in life, from his being so much more in the world than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for suspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had talked more of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be."	"austen"
"Ohhe did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true, so from that moment I set it down as certain."	"austen"
"They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation."	"austen"
"We think NOW,said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, of ROBERT'S marrying Miss Morton."	"austen"
"she was in hysterics all yesterday."	"austen"
"We never could agree in our choice of a profession."	"austen"
"From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and said There is no use in staying here; I must be off."	"austen"
"If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head!"	"austen"
"At last, however, and after I had been six months in England, I DID find her."	"austen"
"It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in need of encouragement and fresh air."	"austen"
"I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by."	"austen"
"Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses."	"austen"
"This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said, I shall always think myself very much obliged to you."	"austen"
"Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt."	"austen"
"Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they likemay resist insult, or return mortificationbut I cannot."	"austen"
"And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life, and I wish you joy of it with all my heart."	"austen"
"Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?"	"austen"
"I am sure you will like them; indeed, you DO like them, you know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!"	"austen"
"She was far from depending on that result of his preference of her, which her mother and sister still considered as certain."	"austen"
"She was perfectly convinced of it."	"austen"
"Is this the real reason of your coming?"	"austen"
"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girlI must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well beyour indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her."	"austen"
"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?"	"austen"
"MY gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end, and HERS must be gained by it in time."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 32 When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see."	"austen"
"Sometimes I thought it had beenbut it never was."	"austen"
"Have you been lately in Sussex?"	"austen"
"Go to him, Elinor, she cried, as soon as she could speak, and force him to come to me."	"austen"
"I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile; though you TOLD me, you know, at Barton, that you should not stay above a MONTH."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 3 Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible."	"austen"
"I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby will do between you about her."	"austen"
"I have many things to support me."	"austen"
"Some more of the Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment."	"austen"
"what can be the meaning of it!"	"austen"
"It puts him quite out of heart."	"austen"
"And there, beneath that farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage."	"austen"
"Yes, continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the worst was over, Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passedfor the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed youa concern which I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character, and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion."	"austen"
"You know him then, said Mrs. Dashwood."	"austen"
"It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage!"	"austen"
"At last, however, my resolution was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone, to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display."	"austen"
"No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him:he knew nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering."	"austen"
"Yescould that be wrong after all that had passed?"	"austen"
"No one, at least, can think I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly expect more."	"austen"
"Sir John could do no more; but he did not know that any more was required: to be together was, in his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being established friends."	"austen"
"The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful contempt."	"austen"
"my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that purchase."	"austen"
"But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated them with the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by her real favour and preference."	"austen"
"You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor Brandon."	"austen"
"Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritable refinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner."	"austen"
"What a happy day for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops!"	"austen"
"Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now."	"austen"
"Why should you be less fortunate than your mother?"	"austen"
"If, however, I am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions, it may be the meansit may put me on my guardat least, it may be something to live for."	"austen"
"They were again silent for many minutes."	"austen"
"The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on, is a most serious drain."	"austen"
"Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all things, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings!"	"austen"
"You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how often I was on the point of falling in with you."	"austen"
"Marianne told her, with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman."	"austen"
"He survived his uncle no longer; and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for his widow and daughters."	"austen"
"No, ma'am, only they two."	"austen"
"It has been involuntary, and I will not encourage it."	"austen"
"So then it all came out; and the long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this."	"austen"
"Did you ever see their equals?"	"austen"
"Pray, pray let me hear it."	"austen"
"Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?"	"austen"
"THEN she fell into hysterics again, and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar."	"austen"
"So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride."	"austen"
"What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him."	"austen"
"He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he was light-headed at the time."	"austen"
"Now there is no one to regard them."	"austen"
"He has, he has, cried Marianne, I am sure he has."	"austen"
"At last we are alone."	"austen"
"Would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned."	"austen"
"Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved."	"austen"
"there is nothing in THAT."	"austen"
"THAT was exactly like Robert,was his immediate observation.And THAT, he presently added, might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began."	"austen"
"His footsteps were heard along the gravel path; in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was before them."	"austen"
"So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord!"	"austen"
"I understand that he intends to take orders."	"austen"
"But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship's head dress slightly scratching the child's neck, produced from this pattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy."	"austen"
"What feelings have they, the season, the air altogether inspired!"	"austen"
"They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended."	"austen"
"Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!No pride, no hauteur, and your sister just the sameall sweetness and affability!"	"austen"
"May she always be poor, if she can employ her riches no better."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 24 In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began."	"austen"
"I suppose Lady Middleton won't ask us any more this bout."	"austen"
"And after thinking it all over and over again, he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they to live upon that?He could not bear to think of her doing no better, and so he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the matter directly, and leave him shift for himself."	"austen"
"One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne's love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible."	"austen"
"Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she could not immediately comprehend."	"austen"
"Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying, It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for me to listen any longer."	"austen"
"Elinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her."	"austen"
"why cannot I speak to him?"	"austen"
"In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits retained the impression of what had passed, the whole evening."	"austen"
"How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on receiving this; and I think you will feel something more than surprise, when you know that I am in town."	"austen"
"It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk."	"austen"
"I assure you I heard of it in my way through town."	"austen"
"His air, his coat, his horse."	"austen"
"On the contrary, every friend must be made still more her friend by them."	"austen"
"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?"	"austen"
"Have you ever seen the lady?"	"austen"
"Miss Dashwood, cried Willoughby, you are now using me unkindly."	"austen"
"Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes?"	"austen"
"Smith had somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connectionbut I need not explain myself farther, he added, looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eyeyour particular intimacyyou have probably heard the whole story long ago."	"austen"
"She observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably going down to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth."	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public a place."	"austen"
"To satisfy me, those characters must be united."	"austen"
"I cannot restI shall not have a moment's peace till this is explainedsome dreadful misapprehension or other."	"austen"
"I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking over the business."	"austen"
"I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU; to assure him that he has made me a veryan exceedingly happy man."	"austen"
"Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even himself."	"austen"
"Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation, was now softened again;yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last."	"austen"
"said she, in a whisper, to Elinor."	"austen"
"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year."	"austen"
"Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby's story from himselfhad she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion would have been greater."	"austen"
"Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word; and almost every thing that WAS said, proceeded from Elinor, who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother's health, their coming to town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about, but never did."	"austen"
"Then you would be very ill-bred, cried Mr. Palmer."	"austen"
"The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half."	"austen"
"He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered himself again, and after saying, Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were so good as to send me, turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined his friend."	"austen"
"I love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me."	"austen"
"About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin's house in Bartlett's Buildings, Holburn, presented themselves again before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality."	"austen"
"He certainly loved her."	"austen"
"Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?No;not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake."	"austen"
"All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour."	"austen"
"You would not be six hours later, said Willoughby, if you were to defer your journey till our return."	"austen"
"He stopt at their gate."	"austen"
"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes, said Elinor, in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated."	"austen"
"But you will not give me your advice, Miss Dashwood?"	"austen"
"Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever be in love more than once in their lifeyour opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?"	"austen"
"Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with them almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister."	"austen"
"After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted."	"austen"
"They think themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises no gratitude at all."	"austen"
"Happy with a man of libertine practices!With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends, and the best of men!Nomy Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!Her conscience, her sensitive conscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt."	"austen"
"You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn."	"austen"
"He is, moreover, aware that she DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, and absent himself from Devonshire for a while."	"austen"
"Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?"	"austen"
"You were all gone I do not know where."	"austen"
"They heard her with surprise."	"austen"
"Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?"	"austen"
"In the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation."	"austen"
"I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy rupture: Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother's notice."	"austen"
"She was before me, constantly before me, as I travelled, in the same look and hue."	"austen"
"When that was once done, however, it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her into the drawing-room immediately."	"austen"
"Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm."	"austen"
"But Sir John did not sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it."	"austen"
"Certainly, returned Mrs. John Dashwood."	"austen"
"Yes, he replied, with some embarrassment, almost ever since; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in my power to return to Barton."	"austen"
"I do think, she continued, nothing was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me."	"austen"
"Marianne hardly knew what to say."	"austen"
"such a deceitful dog!"	"austen"
"Do not boast of it, however, said Elinor, for it is injustice in both of you."	"austen"
"said she, with vexation."	"austen"
"Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post."	"austen"
"Have I explained away any part of my guilt?"	"austen"
"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait."	"austen"
"Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement."	"austen"
"if you knew!And can you believe me to be so, while I see you so wretched!"	"austen"
"To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be thought of;and with a meanness, selfishness, crueltywhich no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too muchI was acting in this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a thought of returning it.But one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated, because I did not THEN know what it was to love."	"austen"
"yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are acquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you."	"austen"
"She was pretty tooat least I thought so THEN; and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no comparisons, and see no defects."	"austen"
"Because you are so sly about it yourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such thing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever so long."	"austen"
"has he written to you?"	"austen"
"If you can think me capable of ever feelingsurely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW."	"austen"
"In that point, however, and that only, he erred;for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to produce this conviction."	"austen"
"I hope he has had no bad news, said Lady Middleton."	"austen"
"Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off the subject, she said to him, Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means?"	"austen"
"You must not confound my meaning."	"austen"
"Marianne's feelings did not stop here."	"austen"
"So far it was all as she had foreseen; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect."	"austen"
"Thank you, Willoughby."	"austen"
"Is there a felicity in the world, said Marianne, superior to this?Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours."	"austen"
"The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks."	"austen"
"He had not seen me then above twice, for it was before I left school."	"austen"
"No one could dispute her right to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of his father's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of immovable disgust."	"austen"
"No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him."	"austen"
"He stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, went on."	"austen"
"It was my father's last request to me, replied her husband, that I should assist his widow and daughters."	"austen"
"This is strange indeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness."	"austen"
"Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles."	"austen"
"As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion."	"austen"
"He, her father, a well-meaning, but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no information; for he had been generally confined to the house, while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself, of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business."	"austen"
"At that moment she first perceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly, had not her sister caught hold of her."	"austen"
"He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled."	"austen"
"When you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do in his heart."	"austen"
"I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood's is not, said Mrs. Jennings, laughing heartily; for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behaved young men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little creature, there is no finding out who SHE likes."	"austen"
"I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy."	"austen"
"It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do."	"austen"
"I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly more extensive."	"austen"
"Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world."	"austen"
"The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for no more."	"austen"
"But Marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions."	"austen"
"It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him."	"austen"
"Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance."	"austen"
"for they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may."	"austen"
"How she should beginhow she should express herself in her note to Edward, was now all her concern."	"austen"
"She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day, when Edward's name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it all."	"austen"
"I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do."	"austen"
"Her complexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and naturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature."	"austen"
"One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles."	"austen"
"My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings's heart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or whose protection will give us consequence."	"austen"
"To be sure, continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both sides, his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast down by it!"	"austen"
"I wish it could be so easily settled."	"austen"
"Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her."	"austen"
"Her affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return."	"austen"
"There were but few who could be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable."	"austen"
"Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party."	"austen"
"But there was no peculiar disgrace in this; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeableWant of sense, either natural or improvedwant of elegancewant of spiritsor want of temper."	"austen"
"He rose from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not knowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice, Perhaps you do not knowyou may not have heard that my brother is lately married toto the youngestto Miss Lucy Steele."	"austen"
"This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry."	"austen"
"Marianne, not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to prevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her carriage was always at Elinor's service, so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward's part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again."	"austen"
"Her husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her objection."	"austen"
"He was a particular friend of Sir John's."	"austen"
"No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour; that your own family might in time relent."	"austen"
"Could it be an impartial one?"	"austen"
"Perhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shewn to her mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars's heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children."	"austen"
"She came hallooing to the window, How do you do, my dear?"	"austen"
"I shall now go away and live in dread of one event."	"austen"
"She insisted on being left behind, the next morning, when the others went out."	"austen"
"You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together."	"austen"
"How they could be thrown together, and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,a girl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his familyit was beyond her comprehension to make out."	"austen"
"If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand."	"austen"
"He engaged to be with them by four o'clock."	"austen"
"To treat her with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Mariannenor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience."	"austen"
"If we find they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed."	"austen"
"Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married."	"austen"
"Pray, when are they to be married?"	"austen"
"She would not even admit it to have been natural; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only could convince her, a better knowledge of mankind."	"austen"
"When they had paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permitted to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add."	"austen"
"Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care."	"austen"
"And who is Miss Williams?"	"austen"
"No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it."	"austen"
"Few people who have so compassionate a heart!"	"austen"
"I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed."	"austen"
"Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is?"	"austen"
"Is he a man of fortune?"	"austen"
"His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment."	"austen"
"Well, Colonel, I have brought two young ladies with me, you seethat is, you see but one of them now, but there is another somewhere."	"austen"
"It had not been built many years and was in good repair."	"austen"
"Hers has been a very short one!"	"austen"
"And I am sure I should not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable situation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU."	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it aloud."	"austen"
"I always thought it such a sweet place, ma'am!"	"austen"
"And why does he regret it?Because he finds it has not answered towards himself."	"austen"
"One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him."	"austen"
"Had my mother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr. Pratt, I thinknay, I am sure, it would never have happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I must have done."	"austen"
"How much they must enjoy it!"	"austen"
"Why, their visit is but just begun!"	"austen"
"And books!Thomson, Cowper, Scottshe would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree."	"austen"
"I have not known you long to be sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by description a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance."	"austen"
"Marianne moved to the window It is Colonel Brandon!"	"austen"
"It was censure in common use, and easily given."	"austen"
"And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law's hands, to admire them herself as they ought to be admired."	"austen"
"cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward."	"austen"
"And now, after only ten minutes noticeGone too without intending to return!Something more than what he owned to us must have happened."	"austen"
"No; considering our situation, it was not strange."	"austen"
"Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil, they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture, and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had been an hour at the Park."	"austen"
"How could such a thought occur to you?"	"austen"
"But at last she found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their's."	"austen"
"And even now, I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage it could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world."	"austen"
"The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense enough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance, supported her into the other room."	"austen"
"He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him quite ill. Did he come from your uncle's, then, when he visited us?"	"austen"
"She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister."	"austen"
"I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since."	"austen"
"That is a material consideration undoubtedly."	"austen"
"It is now three years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,) that I removed her from school, to place her under the care of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation."	"austen"
"After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed Four months!Have you known of this four months?"	"austen"
"Continual engagements at home and abroad, however, supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife."	"austen"
"Such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and seemed hardly to provoke them."	"austen"
"That was what I said immediately."	"austen"
"said II cannot think who you mean."	"austen"
"The possibility of Colonel Brandon's arriving and finding her there, came across her."	"austen"
"He is the curate of the parish I dare say."	"austen"
"Mama, how shall we do without her?"	"austen"
"I had depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe onebut had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now to lament it."	"austen"
"How horrid all this is!"	"austen"
"A letter of proper submission!"	"austen"
"He was silent and grave."	"austen"
"The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know, and that will amuse her."	"austen"
"But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how it happened."	"austen"
"Dear, dear Norland, said Elinor, probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year."	"austen"
"This was the season of happiness to Marianne."	"austen"
"The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;could chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep."	"austen"
"My astonishment!but it would be impossible to describe what I felt."	"austen"
"She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she left no creature behind, from whom it would give her a moment's regret to be divided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of Lucy's friendship, she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring Marianne's peace of mind, and confirming her own."	"austen"
"Indeed, answered Elinor, I have NOT forgotten it."	"austen"
"Had she tried to speak, or had she been conscious of half Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged attentions to her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but not a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her."	"austen"
"One meeting was unavoidable."	"austen"
"Well, Marianne, said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well."	"austen"
"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we did not see the house?"	"austen"
"Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth than she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as they were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point."	"austen"
"Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive, though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner, said no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could, while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it."	"austen"
"Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward, that she acknowledged it with hesitation; which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it."	"austen"
"Such an evening!I ran away from you all as soon as I could; but not before I had seen Marianne's sweet face as white as death.THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;the last manner in which she appeared to me."	"austen"
"It has been, it is a most cruel affliction."	"austen"
"In the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;but that it was not without an effort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sittingher rising colour, as she spoke,and her unsteady voice, plainly shewed."	"austen"
"She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her pace and kept up with her."	"austen"
"Beyond THAT, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart, and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties?"	"austen"
"You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt."	"austen"
"Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton's regret, she had never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions."	"austen"
"But it was neither in Elinor's power, nor in her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed explanation, as had at first been called forth in herself."	"austen"
"I should always be happy, replied Elinor, to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?"	"austen"
"They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to be of the party."	"austen"
"What can you have to do in town at this time of year?"	"austen"
"She explained the situation."	"austen"
"I forget what it was now, but it was something so droll!"	"austen"
"So do I.He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull."	"austen"
"Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness; attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to Marianne, from the communication of what had passed."	"austen"
"Her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of Marianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity."	"austen"
"I do not care if it IS the Doctor's favourite colour."	"austen"
"Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor, She is his natural daughter."	"austen"
"When your father and mother moved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved, and is now left to your mother."	"austen"
"The openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms of politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty a face, was engaging; her folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it was not conceited; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh."	"austen"
"are you never to hear yourself praised!Then you must be no friend of mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to my open commendation."	"austen"
"Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we'd join him in a post-chaise; and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did."	"austen"
"Indeed I believe you, replied Elinor; but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME."	"austen"
"Should not you, Marianne?"	"austen"
"When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected."	"austen"
"Has she run away because we are come?"	"austen"
"Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must have long outlived every sensation of the kind."	"austen"
"Her mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one of the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal."	"austen"
"Something so strange!"	"austen"
"Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her, but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place."	"austen"
"Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough,for, colouring a little, she immediately said, They are very pretty, ma'aman't they?"	"austen"
"At Marlborough!cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at."	"austen"
"Upon my soul it is,was his answer, with a warmth which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself made her think him sincere."	"austen"
"Colonel Brandon tell you of it!"	"austen"
"Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this day's post, is his, if he think it worth his acceptancebut THAT, perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may be nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were more valuable."	"austen"
"'My dear Madam,' I always say to her, 'you must make yourself easy."	"austen"
"Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled in town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty young people, and to amuse them with a ball."	"austen"
"Four years you have been engaged, said she with a firm voice."	"austen"
"And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room."	"austen"
"The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling."	"austen"
"When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall receive you."	"austen"
"Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance, without having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life."	"austen"
"Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his affection for herself out of the question, with his integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a wife like herilliterate, artful, and selfish?"	"austen"
"My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for though I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon having it done."	"austen"
"Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by his distress, could not speak."	"austen"
"And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may make against his interest or pleasure."	"austen"
"Come, Miss Marianne, let us strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye, why so much the better."	"austen"
"And yet it is not very unlikely."	"austen"
"As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged to be excused."	"austen"
"In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable."	"austen"
"Yet such was the case."	"austen"
"I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, and flourishing."	"austen"
"I am sure, for my part, I should never have known he DID like it better than any other colour, if he had not happened to say so."	"austen"
"The children are all hanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance."	"austen"
"Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which, as she now began to feel, her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her;and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor."	"austen"
"She was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend;and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look which spoke at once her gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 4 What a pity it is, Elinor, said Marianne, that Edward should have no taste for drawing."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 34 Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband's judgment, that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former, even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of the most charming women in the world!"	"austen"
"It chiefly consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's."	"austen"
"Lucy's marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all, formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;and Elinor's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard."	"austen"
"But every circumstance that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery of Marianne in a final separation from Willoughbyin an immediate and irreconcilable rupture with him."	"austen"
"He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he came to leave his farewell card; and she, after apologising for not returning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that Miss Dashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him on very particular business."	"austen"
"When he was present she had no eyes for any one else."	"austen"
"And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income, said Marianne."	"austen"
"My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;for not only is it horrible to suspect a person, who has been what HE has been to ME, of such designs,but what must it make me appear to myself?What in a situation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to How then, asked her sister, would you account for his behaviour?"	"austen"
"They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either."	"austen"
"Had I known as much half an hour agoBut since I AM here,speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seatwhat does it signify?For once, Miss Dashwoodit will be the last time, perhapslet us be cheerful together.I am in a fine mood for gaiety."	"austen"
"A man must pay for his convenience; and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money."	"austen"
"Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you, that you will certainly see her to-morrow."	"austen"
"I should guess so, said Elinor, with a smile, from what I have witnessed this morning."	"austen"
"It will be quite delightful, I declare!"	"austen"
"Now, I can think and speak of it with little emotion."	"austen"
"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to thinkin short, that a man, whom I KNEW to be engagedbut how shall I tell you?"	"austen"
"Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor."	"austen"
"His circumstances are now unembarrassedhe suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself."	"austen"
"Elinor made no answer."	"austen"
"Fanny is in her own room, I suppose, said he:I will go to her presently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU."	"austen"
"What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all, since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal, his only object of happiness."	"austen"
"But, in return, your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess."	"austen"
"They contained a noble piece of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages only to be employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure."	"austen"
"I was young once, but I never was very handsomeworse luck for me."	"austen"
"Marianne had left the room before the conversation began."	"austen"
"And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you, because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters.She paused."	"austen"
"Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry."	"austen"
"She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival's intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was unwounded."	"austen"
"I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last, and that was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture."	"austen"
"I have just received my dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you."	"austen"
"Certainly, said Elinor; and assisted by her liberality, I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances."	"austen"
"I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short."	"austen"
"Here comes Marianne, cried Sir John."	"austen"
"Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirty from Combe Magna; and before she had been five minutes within its walls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her child to the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through the winding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a distant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering over a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might be seen."	"austen"
"I must not tell, ma'am."	"austen"
"But yethe is not the kind of young manthere is something wantinghis figure is not striking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister."	"austen"
"When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma'am?"	"austen"
"repeated Edwardbut why must you have hunters?"	"austen"
"He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief."	"austen"
"I could hardly keep my seat."	"austen"
"On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse."	"austen"
"Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street during their absence; but a moment's glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second visit there."	"austen"
"His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained of his poverty."	"austen"
"You tell me that she has forgiven me already."	"austen"
"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement;and though Elinor could not speak, even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder."	"austen"
"You will find me a very awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin."	"austen"
"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such a way, said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; but perhaps there may be reasonsI wish I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent."	"austen"
"It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly's puppies!"	"austen"
"Even now her self-command is invariable."	"austen"
"The pianoforte at which Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself, was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table."	"austen"
"Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his sex might make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy's, nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's."	"austen"
"If her sisters intended to walk on the downs, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be found when the others set off."	"austen"
"Born to the prospect of such affluence!"	"austen"
"Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother."	"austen"
"Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour's conversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education; while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school, was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man."	"austen"
"Whom do you mean, ma'am?"	"austen"
"With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss Dashwood, may be imagined."	"austen"
"You would not have gone, however, said Elinor, recovering herself, and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible, without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been able to give them in person."	"austen"
"This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them."	"austen"
"The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it."	"austen"
"Men are very safe with us, let them be ever so rich."	"austen"
"Well, said he, we have brought you some strangers."	"austen"
"Her guardians, my dear."	"austen"
"Elinor was pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had missed him."	"austen"
"Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known; and at length she obtained her sister's consent to wait for that knowledge."	"austen"
"Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate;and among the merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked as the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost within sight of each other, they could live without disagreement between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands."	"austen"
"Lucy does not want sense, and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.And after all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment, and all that can be said of one's happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is not meantit is not fitit is not possible that it should be so."	"austen"
"But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with them."	"austen"
"Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his sex, of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly perceive, at different times, the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like every other baby of the same age; nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the world."	"austen"
"But that was not smart enough for my family."	"austen"
"You must be very much altered indeed since we parted, if that could be the case, and you not there."	"austen"
"Lord bless you, my dear!Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars!"	"austen"
"Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother's opinion, and she submitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her mother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment's rest."	"austen"
"She saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality, and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;pursuing her own interest in every thought, courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every wealthy friend."	"austen"
"But I have just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me leave, I will drink the wine myself."	"austen"
"Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby's letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married."	"austen"
"But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied, and soon talked of something else."	"austen"
"Yes, I saw every note that passed."	"austen"
"Time, a very little time, I tell him, will do everything;Marianne's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby."	"austen"
"Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going likewise.Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister's account, would be to deprive them both, she thought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, &c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence."	"austen"
"Towards the evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before."	"austen"
"As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both."	"austen"
"CHAPTER 36 Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq."	"austen"
"Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on this attack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to begin her design by saying, as calmly as she could, I like Edward Ferrars very much, and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest of the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, whether I am ever known to them or not."	"austen"
"The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction; under another name, and in another course, it branched out again between two of the steepest of them."	"austen"
"What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, that she did not think THAT any material objection;and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest."	"austen"
"To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any."	"austen"
"She found that she had been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her daughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so well understood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont to believe, or than it was now proved to be."	"austen"
"But that it was so, had not only been declared by Lucy's eyes at the time, but was declared over again the next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone, to tell her how happy she was."	"austen"
"And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone."	"austen"
"How can you say so, Anne?"	"austen"
"I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty."	"austen"
"No, replied he, with sudden consciousness, not to find it in YOU; for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it all.I feel itI would express it if I couldbut, as you well know, I am no orator."	"austen"
"But what could I do!we were engaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixedBut I am talking like a fool."	"austen"
"A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orders on that head."	"austen"
"He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning before the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to themselves."	"austen"
"Nothing escaped HER minute observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted, how much her washing cost per week, and how much she had every year to spend upon herself."	"austen"
"Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again and again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor's side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on Marianne's, as before."	"austen"
"Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street, said he, soon afterwards, rising from his chair."	"austen"
"But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once."	"austen"
"She had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before."	"austen"
"It was the desire of appearing superior to other people."	"austen"
"Their journey was safely performed."	"austen"
"She might in time regain tranquillity; but HE, what had he to look forward to?"	"austen"
"She would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it."	"austen"
"Dear Ma'am, replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended, how good you are!"	"austen"
"And drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer."	"austen"
"Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention; for she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects."	"austen"
"I warrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round."	"austen"
"Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought."	"austen"
"Pray, pray be composed, cried Elinor, and do not betray what you feel to every body present."	"austen"
"From Willoughby their expression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created."	"austen"
"You wrong her exceedingly."	"austen"
"your sister-in-law's brother, Miss Dashwood?"	"austen"
"She feared it was a strengthening regard."	"austen"
"If your sentiments are no longer what they were, you will return my notes, and the lock of my hair which is in your possession."	"austen"
"After a few moments' chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister's being there, quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother's love and liberality, to the prejudice of his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated course of life, and that brother's integrity, was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart."	"austen"
"Have you forgot, Marianne, how many pleasant days we have owed to them?"	"austen"
"Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself."	"austen"
"It is not every one, said Elinor, who has your passion for dead leaves."	"austen"
"I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss Dashwood, when they come to town, said Lucy, returning, after a cessation of hostile hints, to the charge."	"austen"
"It was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother."	"austen"
"How does Mrs. Dashwood do?"	"austen"
"And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?"	"austen"
"You may well be surprised, continued Lucy; for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was always meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour."	"austen"
"Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward."	"austen"
"He never tells me any thing!"	"austen"
"My love, said her mother, you must not be offended with Elinorshe was only in jest."	"austen"
"Marianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell."	"austen"
"You speak very properly."	"austen"
"I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him, but what they are NOW.At present, if I could be satisfied on one point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;but above all, if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him, since the story of that unfortunate girl She stopt."	"austen"
"I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own."	"austen"
"What am I to tell you?"	"austen"
"Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood."	"austen"
"And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first."	"austen"
"I am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation; and though I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional."	"austen"
"In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion."	"austen"
"If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for instance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of me, and never looked at me in a pleasant wayyou know what I meanif I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should have gave it all up in despair."	"austen"
"Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to take it.Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it."	"austen"
"and by the means of this continual though gentle vent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though rather against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her as soon as she married."	"austen"
"My objectmy wishmy sole wish in desiring itI hope, I believe it isis to be a means of giving comfort;no, I must not say comfortnot present comfortbut conviction, lasting conviction to your sister's mind."	"austen"
"The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton."	"austen"
"Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her entirely out of danger."	"austen"
"In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others."	"austen"
"Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood went away delighted with both."	"austen"
"She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another."	"austen"
"I am very sure myself, that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as he has proved himself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM, as she will be with Colonel Brandon."	"austen"
"I think, Elinor, she presently added, we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton."	"austen"
"I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment's alarm on that account from the first."	"austen"
"What had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her mother's servant, on hearing Lucy's message!"	"austen"
"It gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out."	"austen"
"Berkeley Street, January."	"austen"
"he replied, with an air of surprise."	"austen"
"And as it isonly half blood!But you have such a generous spirit!"	"austen"
"In books too, as well as in music, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving."	"austen"
"This, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne, who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, Oh!"	"austen"
"I saw a vast deal more."	"austen"
"It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which afterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession of it, and which finally carried him from Barton."	"austen"
"For their own comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody."	"austen"
"Not at all, I believe, with you."	"austen"
"In what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew not, for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him."	"austen"
"Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,it is worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing."	"austen"
"Her face was crimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion, Good God!"	"austen"
"Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself."	"austen"
"The person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air."	"austen"
"Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late often hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward; and happy above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it."	"austen"
"They were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman."	"austen"
"With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments."	"austen"
"Well, but Miss Dashwood, speaking triumphantly, people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars's declaring he would not have Lucy, for it is no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured reports to be spread abroad."	"austen"
"It was several days before Willoughby's name was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were not so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of Shakespeare, exclaimed, We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it."	"austen"
"But at last a soft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter's wishes and the mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's arm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, in the lane before the house."	"austen"
"She says she never shall think well of anybody again; and one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!meeting with such ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shewn, so much confidence had been placed!"	"austen"
"Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him."	"austen"
"The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs."	"austen"
"It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides."	"austen"
"I shall do THAT directly."	"austen"
"She would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy."	"austen"
"This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more."	"austen"
"However, you will think of all that at your leisure."	"austen"
"No, Marianne.THEN, if I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing could have kept me entirelynot even what I owed to my dearest friendsfrom openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy."	"austen"
"I wonder whether it is so."	"austen"
"My love you contradict every body, said his wife with her usual laugh."	"austen"
"I could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myselfand I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage, in my way to Honiton."	"austen"
"Edward startedReserved!"	"austen"
"Not at allI never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike his brothersilly and a great coxcomb."	"austen"
"I know the summer will pass happily away."	"austen"
"They dined with us last."	"austen"
"Poor dear, it seems quite cruel to let her be alone."	"austen"
"A narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind."	"austen"
"What the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house?"	"austen"
"You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful."	"austen"
"These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage."	"austen"
"He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy."	"austen"
"The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey on both, without essential fatigue."	"austen"
"I am monstrous glad of it."	"austen"
"Whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue."	"austen"
"I wish to assure you both, said she, that I see every thingas you can desire me to do."	"austen"
"Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition."	"austen"
"He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and, after some hesitation, said, Perhaps you meanmy brotheryou mean Mrs.Mrs."	"austen"
"Marianne's note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days, that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been separated, she was as constant in her own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse."	"austen"
"His card was on the table when they came in from the morning's drive."	"austen"
"It is with great regret that I obey your commands in returning the letters with which I have been honoured from you, and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed on me."	"austen"
"Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty."	"austen"
"Business on Sir John's part, and a violent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street."	"austen"
"Do not be alarmed, said Miss Dashwood, nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it."	"austen"
"But I thought I would just tell you of this, because I knew how much it must please you."	"austen"
"They read, they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were considerable; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted."	"austen"
"An opportunity of coming hither, though with Mrs. Jennings, was a temptation we could not resist."	"austen"
"The name of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Greyit was no longer to be a secretit would take place even within a few weeks, with many particulars of preparations and other matters."	"austen"
"You are expecting a letter, then?"	"austen"
"I am almost sure it is, for I saw him cut it off."	"austen"
"I heard it from the servant."	"austen"
"Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before, that it could not be done?"	"austen"
"I am monstrous glad of it, for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know."	"austen"
"Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it."	"austen"
"She dared not look up;but her mother and Marianne both turned their eyes on him."	"austen"
"To Marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother."	"austen"
"Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,instead of remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,she found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments, entering on new duties, placed in a new home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village."	"austen"
"Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this; though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self-control."	"austen"
"returned Elinor in some confusion; indeed, Marianne, I have nothing to tell."	"austen"
"Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman!"	"austen"
"Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she can hardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises."	"austen"
"Elinor told him that it was."	"austen"
"cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with animation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness."	"austen"
"She moved away and sat down."	"austen"
"MY girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolish enough; but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature."	"austen"
"I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin."	"austen"
"To her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind."	"austen"
"She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust."	"austen"
"Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel."	"austen"
"It is all very strange."	"austen"
"how fond he was of it!"	"austen"
"I meant, said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, to inquire for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars."	"austen"
"In a week or two, I suppose, we shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge."	"austen"
"What I thought, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I suffered too."	"austen"
"At one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world, at another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third could resist it with energy."	"austen"
"Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that the livingit is about two hundred a-yearwere much more considerable, and such as might better enable you toas might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourselfsuch, in short, as might establish all your views of happiness."	"austen"
"I have been always used to a very small income, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her."	"austen"
"For a moment or two she could say no more; but when this emotion had passed away, she added, in a firmer tone, Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby."	"austen"
"After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London."	"austen"
"They will be much more able to give YOU something."	"austen"
"She will tell you any thing if you ask."	"austen"
"When do you go back again?"	"austen"
"For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not withhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself."	"austen"
"Elinor would not speak."	"austen"
"The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate."	"austen"
"He makes a monstrous deal of money, and they keep their own coach."	"austen"
"Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the character, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person and talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a feeling, affectionate temper."	"austen"
"She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which, though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks."	"austen"
"She performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration.She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard three times to say, Yes, ma'am.She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward's affection, it cost her only a spasm in her throat.Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself."	"austen"
"She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy."	"austen"
"Yet it certainly soon will happen."	"austen"
"I was to decide on the best of them."	"austen"
"But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it."	"austen"
"By feeling that I was doing my duty.My promise to Lucy, obliged me to be secret."	"austen"
"During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure."	"austen"
"And what does talking ever do you know?"	"austen"
"If that is all, you may be satisfied already,for Marianne DOESshe has LONG forgiven you."	"austen"
"At this time of the year, and after such a series of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it."	"austen"
"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this matter as certain."	"austen"
"If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it."	"austen"
"And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down to reconsider the past, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent."	"austen"
"Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge."	"austen"
"Did you think he came directly from town?"	"austen"
"But still I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to support its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today, accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister's writing."	"austen"
"She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration."	"austen"
"They thanked her; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties."	"austen"
"I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH was plighted to another, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour."	"austen"
"Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear."	"austen"
"I never thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before."	"austen"
"I mean never to be later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading."	"austen"
"Edward have got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go there for a time; and after THAT, as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will be ordained."	"austen"
"Know your own happiness."	"austen"
"Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne's affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude!"	"austen"
"Mrs. Ferrars, added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject, knows nothing about it at present, and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be."	"austen"
"Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced."	"austen"
"But she felt that it was so, long, long before she could feel his influence less."	"austen"
"I do not mean to justify myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urgethat because she was injured she was irreproachable, and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint."	"austen"
"Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed."	"austen"
"They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.Nobody was there."	"austen"
"Marianne, though without knowing it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her."	"austen"
"But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither."	"austen"
"He promised to call again in the course of three or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them."	"austen"
"I am not wishing him too much good, said Marianne at last with a sigh, when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own."	"austen"
"We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived."	"austen"
"Elinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without living near Dawlish."	"austen"
"Humsaid Mrs. Ferrarsvery pretty,and without regarding them at all, returned them to her daughter."	"austen"
"But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed."	"austen"
"Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister?"	"austen"
"He said so repeatedly; other things he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions."	"austen"
"I have never been able, continued Lucy, to give him my picture in return, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so anxious to get it!"	"austen"
"I can believe it, said Elinor; but unfortunately he did not feel the same."	"austen"
"Thomas's intelligence seemed over."	"austen"
"It so happened that while her two sisters with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another of her acquaintance had dropt ina circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her."	"austen"
"Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation."	"austen"
"It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now be very advisable."	"austen"
"We must go, said Sir John.It shall not be put off when we are so near it."	"austen"
"I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture,but if it were newly fitted upa couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms in England."	"austen"
"My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong."	"austen"
"I flatter myself, replied Elinor, that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this."	"austen"
"At last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up, and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand to him."	"austen"
"Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven days are more than enough for others."	"austen"
")No, no; they were shut up in the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at the door."	"austen"
"Did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at Barton?"	"austen"
"Though you do not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him."	"austen"
"He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to hear her."	"austen"
"Willoughby's behaviour in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother's invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her."	"austen"
"He held out his hand."	"austen"
"You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel's general benevolence; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur."	"austen"
"It is not Willoughby."	"austen"
"Then passing through the garden, the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour."	"austen"
"Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning of others, but such of Marianne's expressions as had puzzled him before; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round her, and said, in a whisper, I have been guessing."	"austen"
"I suppose, howeveron recollectionthat the case may probably be THIS."	"austen"
"Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!There's for you, my dear!And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter, except Nancy!Could you have believed such a thing possible?"	"austen"
"He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of improving it."	"austen"
"Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky man.You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I have broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,she will not like to hear it much talked of."	"austen"
"She had an excellent heart;her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught."	"austen"
"I am glad to find, however, from what you say, that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible."	"austen"
"This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt."	"austen"
"I have been told that you were asked to be of the party."	"austen"
"It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before, and requesting the company of her mother and cousins the following evening."	"austen"
"But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what were his designs on her."	"austen"
"It came from town, and is merely a letter of business."	"austen"
"He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always necessitousalways poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife."	"austen"
"It was then about twelve o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the rest of the night."	"austen"
"His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence."	"austen"
"She knew that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment, they believed the nextthat with them, to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect."	"austen"
"His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her."	"austen"
"How could you have consoled her!I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself."	"austen"
"The two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity, were equally earnest in support of their own descendant."	"austen"
"Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?"	"austen"
"Wait for his having a living!ay, we all know how THAT will end:they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it, will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interest of his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her.Then they will have a child every year!"	"austen"
"He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do."	"austen"
"said his wife, laughing."	"austen"
"And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian."	"austen"
"The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love."	"austen"
"was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on."	"austen"
"Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it."	"austen"
"He thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did not repent."	"austen"
"I came only for Willoughby's sakeand now who cares for me?"	"austen"
"But they are Lady Middleton's visitors."	"austen"
"What a blow upon them all was this!"	"austen"
"The independence she settled on Robert, through resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his own choice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do."	"austen"
"Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house?"	"austen"
"Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating."	"austen"
"If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his difficulties from his mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likely to be, when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself."	"austen"
"Never had any week passed so quicklyhe could hardly believe it to be gone."	"austen"
"This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which shortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's feelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue."	"austen"
"But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty."	"austen"
"He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since the first moment of seeing her."	"austen"
"Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite unknown to her."	"austen"
"Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date."	"austen"
"Is every thing finally settled?"	"austen"
"no one, no onehe talked to me only of myself."	"austen"
"Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very compassionate."	"austen"
"After sitting with them a few minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was then at liberty to think and be wretched."	"austen"
"You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose, said Elinor, with a faint smile."	"austen"
"And so, just as he was going away again, it came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news."	"austen"
"It is very right that you SHOULD go to town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London."	"austen"
"Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas?"	"austen"
"In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor."	"austen"
"I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter, and you know young people like to be laughed at about them."	"austen"
"I have good reason to thinkindeed I have it from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about itbut I have it from the very best authoritynot that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herselfbut her daughter DID, and I have it from herThat in short, whatever objections there might be against a certaina certain connectionyou understand meit would have been far preferable to her, it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does."	"austen"
"The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while they remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy's attention to attempt it."	"austen"
"A discovery took place,here he hesitated and looked down.Mrs."	"austen"
"You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of importance."	"austen"
"I am afraid, Miss Marianne, said Sir John, you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today."	"austen"
"Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, and feeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon."	"austen"
"They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations."	"austen"
"Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover."	"austen"
"She was marriedmarried against her inclination to my brother."	"austen"
"I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions."	"austen"
"how he'll chuckle over this news!"	"austen"
"I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU, but so it happened to strike her."	"austen"
"What a softener of the heart was this persuasion!"	"austen"
"Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such a man once, and his name begins with an F. Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this moment, that it rained very hard, though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her ladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother."	"austen"
"The whole of his behaviour, replied Elinor, from the beginning to the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness."	"austen"
"Not aware of their being in town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his coming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings's."	"austen"
"I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house."	"austen"
"Every thing that the most zealous affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable, was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits."	"austen"
"No, none at all, he replied, and read on."	"austen"
"She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present."	"austen"
"We have had great trials, and great persecutions, but however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge many friends, yourself not the least among them, whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of it."	"austen"
"Marianne was quite subdued."	"austen"
"Remember, Elinor, said she, how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post, and carries them to it."	"austen"
"Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present acquaintance."	"austen"
"The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits."	"austen"
"Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other, thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as fast as she could, in favour of each."	"austen"
"But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not blame me."	"austen"
"And, after all, what is it you suspect him of?"	"austen"
"He tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more."	"austen"
"Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to Margaret, Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to repeat them."	"austen"
"But does it follow that had he married you, he would have been happy?The inconveniences would have been different."	"austen"
"To me it is faultless."	"austen"
"It would be the natural result of your affection for her."	"austen"
"A very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England."	"austen"
"He was exactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own, and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else."	"austen"
"I write to the Doctor, indeed!'"	"austen"
"they care no more about such things!"	"austen"
"But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation, though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured."	"austen"
"Why so?we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any."	"austen"
"Pray call again as soon as possible, and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain."	"austen"
"Jennings, with a very intelligent Ah!"	"austen"
"I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope."	"austen"
"The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed."	"austen"
"She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion."	"austen"
"When does she try to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?"	"austen"
"But now she is of age and may choose for herself; and a pretty choice she has made!What now, after pausing a momentyour poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan by herself."	"austen"
"Sir John's confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise, and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world."	"austen"
"But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy, in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure him, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay."	"austen"
"Certainly, said Elinor; he seems very agreeable."	"austen"
"But here, Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity, and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise."	"austen"
"He paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to say, Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable; but your income is a large one."	"austen"
"Marianne here burst forth with indignation Esteem him!"	"austen"
"Marianne's countenance was more communicative."	"austen"
"You do not go to town on horseback, do you?"	"austen"
"The night following this affairI was to go the next morningwas spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be."	"austen"
"I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman."	"austen"
"I am sorry I do NOT, said Elinor, in great astonishment, if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her."	"austen"
"This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly."	"austen"
"It was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their circle of friends: a great comfort to know that there was ONE who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any anxiety for her sister's health."	"austen"
"Sometimes he won't speak to me for half a day together, and then he comes out with something so drollall about any thing in the world."	"austen"
"Oh, don't think of me!"	"austen"
"But this did not last long; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause, at Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's active zeal in the cause of society, procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe."	"austen"
"A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place THEY can ever afford to live in."	"austen"
"He cannot bear writing, you know, she continuedhe says it is quite shocking."	"austen"
"Willoughby filled every page."	"austen"
"Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now, perhapsbut I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her."	"austen"
"At last the affair was decided."	"austen"
"Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of contributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being indisposed."	"austen"
"There now,said his lady, you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you cannot refuse to come."	"austen"
"There, however, he is quite mistaken."	"austen"
"He was recalled from wit to wisdom, not by any reproof of hers, but by his own sensibility."	"austen"
"Could you have a motive for the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?"	"austen"
"Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guests, that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland."	"austen"
"No, ma'am; THAT was not very likely."	"austen"
"YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond thatand how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?"	"austen"
"Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her."	"austen"
"Tell her of my misery and my penitencetell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if you will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever."	"austen"
"Marianne was in a silent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room, where hartshorn restored her a little to herself."	"austen"
"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen."	"austen"
"Upon my soul, he added, I believe it is nothing more; and so I often tell my mother, when she is grieving about it."	"austen"
"But this conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was produced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in the latter."	"austen"
"There is no great wonder in their liking one another; but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody suspect it!THAT is strange!I never happened to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it out directly."	"austen"
"Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited."	"austen"
"Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hung about her and held down his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he could make noise enough at home."	"austen"
"Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenance from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency."	"austen"
"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be."	"austen"
"I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her last moments."	"austen"
"He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room."	"austen"
"I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must."	"austen"
"It was a gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself."	"austen"
"You are very obliging."	"austen"
"Do you suppose him really indifferent to her?"	"austen"
"Look up to it, and be tranquil if you can."	"austen"
"The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance."	"poe"
"A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them."	"poe"
"But my efforts were fruitless."	"poe"
"He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forthin regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-statedan influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spiritan effect which the physique of the grey walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence."	"poe"
"A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps."	"poe"
"But the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for."	"poe"
"Never seraph spread a pinion Over fabric half so fair."	"poe"
"It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty."	"poe"
"Upon my entrance, Usher rose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordialityof the constrained effort of the ennuye man of the world."	"poe"
"Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words."	"poe"
"Wanderers in that happy valley Through two luminous windows saw Spirits moving musically To a lute's well tuned law, Round about a throne, where sitting (Porphyrogene!)"	"poe"
"No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour."	"poe"
"I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul."	"poe"
"In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherencean inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancyan excessive nervous agitation."	"poe"
"The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly huebut the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out."	"poe"
"Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me."	"poe"
"Not hear it?yes, I hear it, and have heard it."	"poe"
"Longlonglongmany minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard ityet I dared notoh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!I dared notI dared not speak!"	"poe"
"I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour."	"poe"
"I tell you that she now stands without the door!"	"poe"
"Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend."	"poe"
"I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions."	"poe"
"A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master."	"poe"
"I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me."	"poe"
"From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly."	"poe"
"Our booksthe books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalidwere, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm."	"poe"
"By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention."	"poe"
"I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth."	"poe"
"I know not how it wasbut, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit."	"poe"
"Here is one of your favourite romances."	"poe"
"Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded: And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound."	"poe"
"At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment."	"poe"
"For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament."	"poe"
"Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant."	"poe"
"And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancya fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me."	"poe"
"I looked upon the scene before meupon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domainupon the bleak wallsupon the vacant eye-like windowsupon a few rank sedgesand upon a few white trunks of decayed treeswith an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opiumthe bitter lapse into everyday lifethe hideous dropping off of the veil."	"poe"
"Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability."	"poe"

"Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtainthat the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more."	"poe"
"It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me."	"poe"

"It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed downbut with a shudder even more thrilling than beforeupon the remodelled and inverted images of the grey sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows."

"His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic concisionthat abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciationthat leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement."

"You have got to leave ."	"wilde"
"Cecily, mamma, whose views on education are remarkably strict, has brought me up to be extremely short-sighted; it is part of her system; so do you mind my looking at you through my glasses?"	"wilde"

"A severe chill, it seems."	"wilde"

"[Merriman begins to clear table and lay cloth."	"wilde"

"But I am bound to state that now that I know that you are Mr. Worthing's ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you werewell, just a little older than you seem to beand not quite so very alluring in appearance."	"wilde"
"My dear fellow, it isn't easy to be anything nowadays."	"wilde"
"A thoroughly experienced French maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space of time."	"wilde"
"You're quite perfect, Miss Fairfax."	"wilde"

"[Lane presents several letters on a salver to Algernon."	"wilde"
"It's the excuse I've always given for your leading such a bad life."	"wilde"

"I hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive."	"wilde"
"Gwendolen, upon my word!"	"wilde"
"If you will allow me, I will copy your remarks into my diary."	"wilde"
"I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say."	"wilde"
"Pray open it at page fifteen."	"wilde"
"Finished what, may I ask?"	"wilde"
"To say nothing of the fact that she is my ward."	"wilde"
"Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax."	"wilde"
"But what proof have I of their authenticity?"	"wilde"
"For me you have always had an irresistible fascination."	"wilde"

"Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace."	"wilde"
"And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song."	"wilde"
"In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met."	"wilde"
"It was certainly a magnificent display."	"wilde"
"It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular."	"wilde"
"Very important for you, I have no doubt, answered the Rocket, but I shall weep if I choose; and he actually burst into real tears, which flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were looking for a nice dry spot to live in."	"wilde"
"May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?"	"wilde"
"Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?"	"wilde"
"He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly."	"wilde"
"Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice."	"wilde"
"'My dear friend, my best friend,' cried little Hans, 'you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden."	"wilde"
"Quite dead, whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep."	"wilde"
"But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?"	"wilde"
"I hate people who cry over spilt milk."	"wilde"
"How selfish I have been!"	"wilde"
"Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost."	"wilde"
"My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other."	"wilde"
"She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle."	"wilde"
"A new arrival, I see!"	"wilde"
"My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor."	"wilde"
"The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal."	"wilde"
"Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do."	"wilde"
"But none of you have any hearts."	"wilde"
"'I am very sorry,' answered the Miller, 'but it is my new lantern and it would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.'"	"wilde"
"And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads."	"wilde"
"It is a most joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it."	"wilde"
"If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine."	"wilde"
"'It is some poor traveller,' said little Hans to himself, and he ran to the door."	"wilde"
"She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled."	"wilde"
"But what became of the Miller?"	"wilde"
"I knew I should create a great sensation, gasped the Rocket, and he went out. "	"wilde"
"Thinking always made him sleepy."	"wilde"
"GOLD Stick, that is what he said."	"wilde"
"You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn."	"wilde"
"cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing."	"wilde"
"He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing."	"wilde"
"asked a green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation."	"wilde"
"How lucky you mentioned it!"	"wilde"
"It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature."	"wilde"
"Of myself, said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled."	"wilde"
"My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest."	"wilde"
"said the Water-rat, after a long pause."	"wilde"
"What a curious shape you are!"	"wilde"
"I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart's-blood."	"wilde"
"There was no doubt about it."	"wilde"
"Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go."	"wilde"
"* * * * * THE DEVOTED FRIEND One morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole."	"wilde"
"It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass."	"wilde"
"Well, I said Pylotechnic, answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance."	"wilde"
"Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble."	"wilde"
"Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit."	"wilde"
"What a silly question!"	"wilde"
"Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don't like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish."	"wilde"
"they will come to you,' said the Miller, 'but you must take more pains."	"wilde"
"He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking."	"wilde"
"It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost."	"wilde"
"I will stay with you one night longer, said the Swallow, but I cannot pluck out your eye."	"wilde"
"And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn."	"wilde"
"Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter."	"wilde"
"is he not solid gold?"	"wilde"
"Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful."	"wilde"
"The poor children had now nowhere to play."	"wilde"
"And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!"	"wilde"
"Early the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors."	"wilde"
"Here is the reddest rose in all the world."	"wilde"
"So little Hans worked away in his garden."	"wilde"
"Your picture was beautiful, he murmured, but you are more beautiful than your picture; and the little Princess blushed."	"wilde"
"The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing."	"wilde"
"At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you will have the theory also.'"	"wilde"
"Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away."	"wilde"
"Good-bye, cried the Fire-balloon as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks."	"wilde"
"There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back."	"wilde"
"'Dear little Hans,' cried the Miller, 'I am in great trouble."	"wilde"
"Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy's forehead with his wings."	"wilde"
"One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table."	"wilde"
"The fact is, that I told him a story with a moral."	"wilde"
"said the Rocket, impossible!"	"wilde"
"It is going to rain sticks; and she rushed into the water."	"wilde"
"Then one of them caught sight of him."	"wilde"
"It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof."	"wilde"
"'Hans, I am surprised at you,' said the Miller; 'friendship never forgets."	"wilde"
"And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?"	"wilde"
"In fact, he mistakes me for one of the Court dignitaries!"	"wilde"
"Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family."	"wilde"
"Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder and looked and looked."	"wilde"
"When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars."	"wilde"
"I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind, for I am extremely sensitive."	"wilde"
"No, answered the Linnet, I don't think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face."	"wilde"
"Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children's faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street."	"wilde"
"Be happy, cried the Nightingale, be happy; you shall have your red rose."	"wilde"
"and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright."	"wilde"
"He must have a truly romantic nature, said the Catherine Wheel, for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about; and she heaved a deep sigh and thought about the deal box."	"wilde"
"said the Rocket indignantly; you forget that I am very uncommon, and very remarkable."	"wilde"
"The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well."	"wilde"
"It is quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship."	"wilde"
"However, he was so young that you must excuse him."	"wilde"
"What a silly thing Love is!"	"wilde"
"said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale; 'really I feel quite drowsy."	"wilde"
"Then, when the autumn came they all flew away."	"wilde"
"His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed."	"wilde"
"And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys."	"wilde"
"She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer."	"wilde"
"'Well, really,' cried Hans, 'it is very good of you to ask, very good indeed."	"wilde"
"That is not conversation."	"wilde"
"said the Mathematical Master, you have never seen one."	"wilde"
"We must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here."	"wilde"
"He saw a most wonderful sight."	"wilde"
"There is a way, answered the Tree; but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."	"wilde"
"In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer's wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us."	"wilde"
"I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever."	"wilde"
"They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago."	"wilde"
"And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper."	"wilde"
"Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came."	"wilde"
"However, they did not seem to have much effect."	"wilde"
"Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming."	"wilde"
"In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms."	"wilde"
"That at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right."	"wilde"
"Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor's house with the rose in his hand."	"wilde"
"All night long she sang and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her."	"wilde"
"She has no conversation, he said, and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind."	"wilde"
"The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer, said the Mayor; in fact, he is little better than a beggar!"	"wilde"
"In fact, I shall go so high that Fizz!"	"wilde"
"Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller."	"wilde"
"Here at last is a true lover, said the Nightingale."	"wilde"
"What a strange thing!"	"wilde"
"whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice."	"wilde"
"In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style without any sincerity."	"wilde"
"I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.'"	"wilde"
"'Besides,' he used to say, 'he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.'"	"wilde"
"The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad."	"wilde"
"My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers."	"wilde"
"Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend."	"wilde"
"It certainly was a marvellous sight."	"wilde"
"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, will you not stay with me one night longer?"	"wilde"
"If you want to give pleasure to others, cried the Roman Candle, you had better keep yourself dry."	"wilde"
"After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way."	"wilde"
"'I have no doubt of it,' answered the Miller, 'but now that you have mended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive my sheep to the mountain to-morrow.'"	"wilde"
"Pluck out my other eye and give it to her, and her father will not beat her."	"wilde"
"My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move."	"wilde"
"He is as beautiful as a weathercock, remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; only not quite so useful, he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not."	"wilde"
"Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!"	"wilde"
"It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm."	"wilde"
"'You are certainly very thoughtful about others,' answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; 'very thoughtful indeed."	"wilde"
"cried one of the boys, look at this old stick!"	"wilde"
"But I have imagination, for I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as being quite different."	"wilde"
"I wonder how it came here; and he picked the Rocket out of the ditch."	"wilde"
"they cried; how very ridiculous!"	"wilde"
"So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince's sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town."	"wilde"
"cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom window."	"wilde"
"When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated."	"wilde"
"It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree."	"wilde"
"He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales."	"wilde"
"screamed the Water-rat."	"wilde"
"Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy."	"wilde"
"What a curious thing!"	"wilde"
"Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed."	"wilde"
"It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals."	"wilde"
"In fact, he had a most distinguished manner."	"wilde"
"so he enjoyed himself very much."	"wilde"
"They danced so beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time."	"wilde"
"What right have you to be happy?"	"wilde"
"Give me a red rose, she cried, and I will sing you my sweetest song."	"wilde"
"During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts."	"wilde"
"and he threw him over the wall into the ditch."	"wilde"
"Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain."	"wilde"
"You must not lie here, shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain."	"wilde"
"he cried, and he made himself very stiff and straight."	"wilde"
"So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees."	"wilde"
"True love suffers, and is silent."	"wilde"
"Spring has forgotten this garden, they cried, so we will live here all the year round."	"wilde"
"Nothing of the kind, answered the Duck, every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient."	"wilde"
"Her long ermine cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived."	"wilde"
"She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove."	"wilde"
"I am afraid you don't quite see the moral of the story, remarked the Linnet."	"wilde"
"What is a sensitive person?"	"wilde"
"He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple."	"wilde"
"I have no ruby now, said the Prince; my eyes are all that I have left."	"wilde"
"said the Miller, 'there is no work so delightful as the work one does for others.'"	"wilde"
"At last he came to the poor house and looked in."	"wilde"
"Flame-coloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body."	"wilde"
"I know nothing about the feelings of parents, said the Water-rat; I am not a family man."	"wilde"
"Then the Squibs danced all over the place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet."	"wilde"
"I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched."	"wilde"
"You are blind now, he said, so I will stay with you always."	"wilde"
"What are you doing here?"	"wilde"
"He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber."	"wilde"
"the higher things of life, how fine they are!"	"wilde"
"He had just strength to fly up to the Prince's shoulder once more."	"wilde"
"To-night I go to Egypt, said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect."	"wilde"
"Certainly not, answered the Linnet, that is the beginning."	"wilde"
"That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don't understand the poetry of life."	"wilde"
"My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction."	"wilde"
"Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved."	"wilde"
"said the Rocket, and he began to cough."	"wilde"
"As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette."	"wilde"
"So the Swallow plucked out the Prince's eye, and flew away to the student's garret."	"wilde"
"said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market, and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back."	"wilde"
"But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am much affected."	"wilde"
"he said; I hope the town has made preparations."	"wilde"
"However, he went on bravely, and at last he reached the market."	"wilde"
"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, far away across the city I see a young man in a garret."	"wilde"
"I shall never get over it."	"wilde"
"The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant's garden she gave none."	"wilde"
"One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing."	"wilde"
"he said, and he went to work at once."	"wilde"
"One red rose is all I want, cried the Nightingale, only one red rose!"	"wilde"
"Then another drop fell."	"wilde"
"You had really better keep yourself dry, said the Fire-balloon."	"wilde"
"He is weeping for a red rose, said the Nightingale."	"wilde"
"He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold."	"wilde"
"There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the other."	"wilde"
"Sing me one last song, he whispered; I shall feel very lonely when you are gone."	"wilde"
"There is no good talking to him, said a dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; no good at all, for he has gone away."	"wilde"
"Why, I don't believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain's nephew has; and she got up from her chair and went into the house."	"wilde"
"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, do as I command you."	"wilde"
"Bring me the two most precious things in the city, said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird."	"wilde"
"He has a fever, and is asking for oranges."	"wilde"
"Why, you don't even know him, growled the Roman Candle."	"wilde"
"It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by."	"wilde"
"He was very much admired indeed."	"wilde"
"I have six beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them."	"wilde"
"Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that would be something."	"wilde"
"they said to each other."	"wilde"
"Certainly, said the Linnet."	"wilde"
"The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes."	"wilde"
"Then you are quite behind the age, said the Water-rat."	"wilde"
"I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher than the moon, much higher than the sun."	"wilde"
"She would not sacrifice herself for others."	"wilde"
"What a lovely bit of glass!"	"wilde"
"The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea."	"wilde"
"He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in."	"wilde"
"At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned."	"wilde"
"As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature."	"wilde"
"at the top of their voices."	"wilde"
"Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?"	"wilde"
"BAD and GRAND sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same; and he fell into the mud."	"wilde"
"how shabby the Happy Prince looks!"	"wilde"
"I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day;' and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller's basket."	"wilde"
"'The Miller's son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and the Miller wants you to come at once.'"	"wilde"
"'Lots of people act well,' answered the Miller; 'but very few people talk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of the two, and much the finer thing also'; and he looked sternly across the table at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his head down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea."	"wilde"
"Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never quite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for, whatever he did, everybody cried out, Charming!"	"wilde"
"But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want."	"wilde"
"I don't think I like boys, answered the Swallow."	"wilde"
"'What a silly boy you are!'"	"wilde"
"So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow."	"wilde"
"cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince."	"wilde"
"Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned."	"wilde"
"The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom."	"wilde"
"And mind you take the big basket with you for the flowers.'"	"wilde"
"I am glad that she has gone, he said to himself, she has a decidedly middle-class mind; and he sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the loneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came running down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots."	"wilde"
"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, do as I command you."	"wilde"
"Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like."	"wilde"
"All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye."	"wilde"
"He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years."	"wilde"
"So at the end of the King's garden a great stand had been set up, and as soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place, the fireworks began to talk to each other."	"wilde"
"That is what is called sympathy."	"wilde"
"How I would like to see him!"	"wilde"
"But at last he knew that he was going to die."	"wilde"
"I have never seen any rose like it in all my life."	"wilde"
"Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I am going back to Court almost immediately."	"wilde"
"That is the new method."	"wilde"
"And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn."	"wilde"
"At last, however, the fire caught him."	"wilde"
"Give me a red rose, she cried, and I will sing you my sweetest song."	"wilde"
"I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do."	"wilde"
"I am going to the House of Death."	"wilde"
"The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy."	"wilde"
"But the Tree shook its head."	"wilde"
"Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature."	"wilde"
"The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness."	"wilde"
"You have rightly chosen, said God, for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me."	"wilde"
"But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept."	"wilde"
"He always coughed before he made any observation, so as to attract attention."	"wilde"
"So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron chain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm."	"wilde"
"Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.'"	"wilde"
"So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial."	"wilde"
"And how do you like the Water-rat?"	"wilde"
"She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl."	"wilde"
"So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples."	"wilde"
"She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break."	"wilde"
"As soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and began."	"wilde"
"The King is there himself in his painted coffin."	"wilde"
"It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold."	"wilde"
"It is applicable to you, answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend."	"wilde"
"'They are certainly very lovely,' said Hans, 'and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many."	"wilde"
"In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray."	"wilde"
"It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl."	"wilde"
"Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic art."	"wilde"
"I had thoughts of entering public life once myself, remarked the Duck; there are so many things that need reforming."	"wilde"
"But the Tree shook its head."	"wilde"

"they shouted as each chest came up."	"wilde"
"It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter."	"wilde"
"little boy, said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny."	"wilde"

"So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid."	"wilde"
"Then all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the back of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch."	"wilde"
"'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'I do not think it is much to ask of you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of course if you refuse I will go and do it myself.'"	"wilde"
"My roses are white, it answered; as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain."	"wilde"
"Well, that is his loss, not mine, answered the Rocket."	"wilde"
"Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a provincial."	"wilde"

"So he plucked out the Prince's other eye, and darted down with it."	"wilde"
"'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers."	"wilde"
"I have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us."	"wilde"
"It is not in very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you."	"wilde"

"Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher."	"wilde"
"And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot choose but weep."	"wilde"
"'That was kind of you,' said Hans; 'I was half afraid you had forgotten me.'"	"wilde"
"It is a ridiculous attachment, twittered the other Swallows; she has no money, and far too many relations; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds."	"wilde"
"Will you come away with me?"	"wilde"
"He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered 'Pooh!'"	"wilde"
"It may be so with you, he answered; indeed, I have no doubt that it is, but with me it is different."	"wilde"
"The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver."	"wilde"

"I hope, at any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here."	"wilde"
"They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract."	"wilde"
"But the girl frowned."	"wilde"
"All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though he is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty."	"wilde"
"The Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn."	"wilde"
"'I am very sorry,' said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, 'but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing."	"wilde"
"We must throw it away."	"wilde"
"He has a great many good points, but for my own part I have a mother's feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes."	"wilde"
"So I shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses, and that will make him so happy.'"	"wilde"
"said the Cracker to the Roman Candle."	"wilde"

"I heard all about them this morning from a brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as myself, and he knew the latest Court news."	"wilde"
"cried the Miller; 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school."	"wilde"

"cried his Wife; 'you are always thinking of others."	"wilde"
"The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour."	"wilde"

"She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder."	"wilde"
"It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends."	"wilde"
"Flour is one thing and friendship is another, and they should not be confused."	"wilde"
"It is not comfortable here, he remarked, but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health."	"wilde"
"'And how have you been all the winter?'"	"wilde"
"He picked up crumbs outside the baker's door when the baker was not looking, and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings."	"wilde"
"Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions."	"wilde"
"I never said that they had, replied the Rocket; I said that they might."	"wilde"
"and he went straight up into the air."	"wilde"
"So they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit the fire."	"wilde"
"Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle."	"wilde"
"Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead, she murmured."	"wilde"
"said the Miller's youngest son."	"wilde"
"He did not hate the winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting."	"wilde"
"'Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?'"	"wilde"
"So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden."	"wilde"
"'Well, I am glad of that,' said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the back, 'for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed and mend my barn-roof for me.'"	"wilde"
"But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year."	"wilde"
"'But could we not ask little Hans up here?'"	"wilde"
"When the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince."	"wilde"
"I shall set the whole world on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for a whole year."	"wilde"
"Have you any commissions for Egypt?"	"wilde"
"Thank you, little Swallow, said the Prince."	"wilde"
"He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child."	"wilde"
"'Oh, I am so sorry,' said Hans, 'but I am really very busy to-day."	"wilde"
"So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying."	"wilde"
"So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read."	"wilde"
"That is a very selfish reason, said the Rocket angrily."	"wilde"
"Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.'"	"wilde"
"Now I can finish my play, and he looked quite happy."	"wilde"
"Once upon a time, said the Linnet, there was an honest little fellow named Hans."	"wilde"
"and the King doubled his salary a second time."	"wilde"
"And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion."	"wilde"
"It is your garden now, little children, said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall."	"wilde"
"Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted."	"wilde"
"Who hath dared to wound thee?"	"wilde"
"My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing."	"wilde"
"They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it."	"wilde"
"So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a notebook, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar."	"wilde"
"he said: the boy I put into the tree."	"wilde"
"Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there."	"wilde"
"They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised."	"wilde"
"he cried; I am just starting."	"wilde"
"Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart."	"wilde"
"He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets."	"wilde"
"Then ten o'clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist."	"wilde"

"I admit that she is domestic, he continued, but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also."	"wilde"
"No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that."	"wilde"
"And he certainly did explode."	"wilde"
"But you must lend me your lantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the ditch.'"	"wilde"
"'What a delightful time I shall have in my garden!'"	"wilde"
"Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next morning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans started off with them to the mountain."	"wilde"
"And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring."	"wilde"
"Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him."	"wilde"
"She was one of those people who think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times, it becomes true in the end."	"wilde"
"What a delightful voice you have!"	"wilde"
"'Well, really,' said the Miller, 'I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.'"	"wilde"
"My own garden is my own garden, said the Giant; any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself."	"wilde"
"When I was alive and had a human heart, answered the statue, I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter."	"wilde"
"Everybody can see that.'"	"wilde"
"I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.'"	"wilde"
"Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams."	"wilde"
"GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said."	"wilde"
"I will stay with you always, said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet."	"wilde"
"The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them."	"wilde"
"Well, said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, as soon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale yellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see little Hans."	"wilde"
"said the Student as he walked away."	"wilde"
"said the Duck; and that reminds me how hungry I feel: and she swam away down the stream, saying, Quack, quack, quack."	"wilde"
"Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy."	"wilde"

"But the Tree shook its head."	"wilde"
"I like hearing myself talk."	"wilde"
"Well, well, said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and never quarrelled with any one, everybody has different tastes."	"wilde"
"He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden."	"wilde"
"'Little Hans, Doctor.'"	"wilde"
"'It is quite mended,' answered little Hans, coming down the ladder."	"wilde"
"As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree."	"wilde"
"It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair that I could not get anything for it if I sold it."	"wilde"
"'It is not a very big plank,' said the Miller, looking at it, 'and I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won't be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault."	"wilde"
"It is quite clear that they love each other, said the little Page, as clear as crystal!"	"wilde"
"He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came to see how he was getting on."	"wilde"
"Is there no way by which I can get it?"	"wilde"
"He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play."	"wilde"

"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, will you not stay with me one night longer?"	"wilde"
"I am the Happy Prince."	"wilde"
"And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise."	"wilde"

"They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all."	"wilde"
"Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell."	"wilde"
"And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky."	"wilde"

"I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful things as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear a gold ring on his little finger.'"	"wilde"
"Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich Miller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred sacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large flock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these things, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true friendship."	"wilde"
"he cried; here is a red rose!"	"wilde"
"He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her."	"wilde"
"We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient."	"wilde"
"In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be."	"wilde"
"'Good morning,' said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to ear."	"wilde"
"You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so it is only fair that you should do something for me in return.'"	"wilde"

"One night there flew over the city a little Swallow."	"wilde"
"The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use."	"wilde"
"You should be thinking about others."	"wilde"
"The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan's wings lay the little Princess herself."	"wilde"

"In fact, you should be thinking about me."	"wilde"
"he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away."	"wilde"
"It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true."	"wilde"
"I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents."	"wilde"
"I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention."	"wilde"
"I have many beautiful flowers, he said; but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all."	"wilde"
"I am beginning to be appreciated, he cried; this is from some great admirer."	"wilde"

"You are a very irritating person, said the Rocket, and very ill-bred."	"wilde"
"When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand."	"wilde"
"inquired the Rocket; I am not laughing."	"wilde"
"Yes, that is just what I want to know, said the Duck; and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example."	"wilde"
"Give me a red rose, she cried, and I will sing you my sweetest song."	"wilde"
"What a remarkable phenomenon, said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge."	"wilde"
"they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies."	"wilde"
"All the next day he sat on the Prince's shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands."	"wilde"
"But pray go on with your story."	"wilde"
"Whenever we appear we excite great attention."	"wilde"
"said the little Squib, I thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince's honour."	"wilde"

"HAMLET Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET I mean, my head upon your lap?"	"shakespeare"
"You have been talk'd of since your travel much, And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege."	"shakespeare"
"I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be, When thou liest howling."	"shakespeare"

"MARCELLUS Nor I, my lord."	"shakespeare"

"LAERTES To cut his throat i' the church."	"shakespeare"
"I bought an unction of a mountebank, So mortal that, but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly, It may be death."

"First Clown Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras."	"shakespeare"
"KING CLAUDIUS Not that I think you did not love your father; But that I know love is begun by time; And that I see, in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it."	"shakespeare"
"OPHELIA You are merry, my lord."	"shakespeare"
"Exit HORATIO O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs All from her father's death."	"shakespeare"

"First Clown It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else."	"shakespeare"
"If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business."	"shakespeare"
"Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about, Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust, All my smooth body."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET The concernancy, sir?"	"shakespeare"
"OPHELIA Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this: Sings To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day, All in the morning betime, And I a maid at your window, To be your Valentine."	"shakespeare"
"KING CLAUDIUS How may we try it further?"	"shakespeare"
"Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?"	"shakespeare"
"And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars and soldiers, Give me one poor request."	"shakespeare"
"LAERTES For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more."	"shakespeare"
"art thou there, truepenny?"	"shakespeare"
"O, how the wheel becomes it!"	"shakespeare"
"Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him."	"shakespeare"
"I charge thee, speak!"	"shakespeare"
"First Clown Ay, tell me that, and unyoke."	"shakespeare"
"KING CLAUDIUS He made confession of you, And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise in your defence And for your rapier most especially, That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed, If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation, He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye, If you opposed them."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs."	"shakespeare"
"Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you."	"shakespeare"
"OPHELIA There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, love, remember: and there is pansies."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET In happy time."	"shakespeare"
"God be at your table!"	"shakespeare"
"BERNARDO Say, What, is Horatio there?"	"shakespeare"
"And hitherto doth love on fortune tend; For who not needs shall never lack a friend, And who in want a hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy."	"shakespeare"
"Lying down at OPHELIA's feet OPHELIA No, my lord."	"shakespeare"
"a' poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once."	"shakespeare"
"QUEEN GERTRUDE O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain."	"shakespeare"
"Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants Enter POLONIUS LORD POLONIUS The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully return'd."	"shakespeare"
"QUEEN GERTRUDE I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me."	"shakespeare"
"O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it."	"shakespeare"
"Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!"	"shakespeare"
"GUILDENSTERN Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof, When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Into my grave."	"shakespeare"
"LAERTES I'm lost in it, my lord."	"shakespeare"
"ROSENCRANTZ She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you go to bed."	"shakespeare"

"POLONIUS hides behind the arras Enter HAMLET HAMLET Now, mother, what's the matter?"	"shakespeare"

"REYNALDO My lord, I did intend it."	"shakespeare"
"GUILDENSTERN Believe me, I cannot."	"shakespeare"
"Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is."	"shakespeare"
"To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Why, what should be the fear?"	"shakespeare"
"HORATIO No, by no means."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me."	"shakespeare"
"OPHELIA What means your lordship?"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET The point!envenom'd too!"	"shakespeare"
"OSRIC The carriages, sir, are the hangers."	"shakespeare"
"Second Clown The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants."	"shakespeare"
"HORATIO Not a jot more, my lord."	"shakespeare"
"But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet against the Danish."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure."	"shakespeare"
"Exit HAMLET Madam, how like you this play?"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command; or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you say, ROSENCRANTZ Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration."	"shakespeare"
"GUILDENSTERN What should we say, my lord?"	"shakespeare"
"Therefore prepare you; I your commission will forthwith dispatch, And he to England shall along with you: The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies."	"shakespeare"
"Farewell, dear mother."	"shakespeare"
"Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO HAMLET Why, let the stricken deer go weep, The hart ungalled play; For some must watch, while some must sleep: So runs the world away."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he's an arrant knave."	"shakespeare"
"for every thing is seal'd and done That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste."	"shakespeare"
"But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article; and his infusion of such dearth and rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more."	"shakespeare"
"HORATIO Nay, good my lord, HAMLET It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman."	"shakespeare"
"First Clown Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even Christian."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Words, words, words."	"shakespeare"
"ROSENCRANTZ Good my lord!"	"shakespeare"
"HORATIO I warrant it will."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation coped withal."	"shakespeare"
"KING CLAUDIUS Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage; For we will fetters put upon this fear, Which now goes too free-footed."	"shakespeare"
"To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved, Or not at all."	"shakespeare"
"There's a letter for you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is."	"shakespeare"
"No, I went round to work, And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: 'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star; This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens."	"shakespeare"
"You have me, have you not?"	"shakespeare"
"I remember, one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine."	"shakespeare"
"Sport and repose lock from me day and night!"	"shakespeare"
"man delights not me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so."	"shakespeare"
"GUILDENSTERN No, my lord, rather with choler."	"shakespeare"
"Leave wringing of your hands: peace!"	"shakespeare"
"What, have you given him any hard words of late?"	"shakespeare"
"KING CLAUDIUS Set me the stoops of wine upon that table."	"shakespeare"
"HORATIO Not I, my lord, by heaven."	"shakespeare"
"OPHELIA I do not know, my lord, what I should think."	"shakespeare"
"Exit KING CLAUDIUS Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you."	"shakespeare"
"Player King I do believe you think what now you speak; But what we do determine oft we break."	"shakespeare"
"But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, To prick and sting her."	"shakespeare"
"OPHELIA My honour'd lord, you know right well you did; And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed As made the things more rich: their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind."	"shakespeare"
"An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET How is it with you, lady?"	"shakespeare"
"KING CLAUDIUS We will try it."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Why he more than another?"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by The important acting of your dread command?"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum."	"shakespeare"
"Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends; And let them know, both what we mean to do, And what's untimely done."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Do you see nothing there?"	"shakespeare"
"KING CLAUDIUS She swounds to see them bleed."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive."	"shakespeare"
"But, orderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown; Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own: So think thou wilt no second husband wed; But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead."	"shakespeare"
"Never alone Did the king sigh, but with a general groan."	"shakespeare"
"LORD POLONIUS Farewell!"	"shakespeare"
"all is not well; I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion."	"shakespeare"
"KING CLAUDIUS Laertes, was your father dear to you?"	"shakespeare"
"LORD POLONIUS I will say so."	"shakespeare"
"Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade."	"shakespeare"
"Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, And batten on this moor?"	"shakespeare"
"MARCELLUS BERNARDO We do, my lord."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student; I think it was to see my mother's wedding."	"shakespeare"
"A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him."	"shakespeare"
"PRINCE FORTINBRAS Go softly on."	"shakespeare"
"LAERTES Why ask you this?"	"shakespeare"
"in apprehension how like a god!"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Nor the soles of her shoe?"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET I see a cherub that sees them."	"shakespeare"
"QUEEN GERTRUDE Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me."	"shakespeare"
"in form and moving how express and admirable!"	"shakespeare"
"why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?"	"shakespeare"
"I must be cruel, only to be kind: Thus bad begins and worse remains behind."	"shakespeare"
"Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended KING CLAUDIUS I have sent to seek him, and to find the body."	"shakespeare"
"QUEEN GERTRUDE Have you forgot me?"	"shakespeare"
"And with such maimed rites?"	"shakespeare"
"KING CLAUDIUS Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in."	"shakespeare"
"That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity; And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure; But farewell it, for I will use no art."	"shakespeare"
"No, in despite of sense and secrecy, Unpeg the basket on the house's top."	"shakespeare"
"KING CLAUDIUS I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine."	"shakespeare"
"I will bestow him, and will answer well The death I gave him."	"shakespeare"
"Exit OPHELIA O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!"	"shakespeare"
"If that his majesty would aught with us, We shall express our duty in his eye; And let him know so."	"shakespeare"
"Enter GHOST and HAMLET HAMLET Where wilt thou lead me?"	"shakespeare"
"I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are."	"shakespeare"
"KING CLAUDIUS The very same."	"shakespeare"
"OSRIC I thank your lordship, it is very hot."	"shakespeare"
"HORATIO Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?"	"shakespeare"
"LAERTES And so have I a noble father lost; A sister driven into desperate terms, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections: but my revenge will come."	"shakespeare"
"They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for them."	"shakespeare"
"Exit Servant I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET How chances it they travel?"	"shakespeare"
"GUILDENSTERN O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly."	"shakespeare"
"QUEEN GERTRUDE What would she have?"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Why, 'As by lot, God wot,' and then, you know, 'It came to pass, as most like it was,' the first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look, where my abridgement comes."	"shakespeare"
"HORATIO It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silver'd."	"shakespeare"
"Exit POLONIUS O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven; It hath the primal eldest curse upon't, A brother's murder."	"shakespeare"
"ROSENCRANTZ My most dear lord!"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't."	"shakespeare"
"QUEEN GERTRUDE How now, Ophelia!"	"shakespeare"
"HORATIO O, my dear lord, HAMLET Nay, do not think I flatter; For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits, To feed and clothe thee?"	"shakespeare"
"Is it a free visitation?"	"shakespeare"
"LAERTES O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head, Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of!"	"shakespeare"
"Exit POLONIUS He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son's distemper."	"shakespeare"
"QUEEN GERTRUDE For love of God, forbear him."	"shakespeare"
"O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!"	"shakespeare"
"Let them guard the door."	"shakespeare"
"Exit KING CLAUDIUS I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him."	"shakespeare"
"ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN We'll wait upon you."	"shakespeare"
"KING CLAUDIUS Good Laertes, If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge, That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe, Winner and loser?"	"shakespeare"
"Masters, you are all welcome."	"shakespeare"
"Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS MARCELLUS How is't, my noble lord?"	"shakespeare"
"Ghost I am thy father's spirit, Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confined to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away."	"shakespeare"
"Quoth she, before you tumbled me, You promised me to wed."	"shakespeare"
"Once more, good night: And when you are desirous to be bless'd, I'll blessing beg of you."	"shakespeare"
"LAERTES Must there no more be done?"	"shakespeare"
"LORD POLONIUS I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the Capitol; Brutus killed me."	"shakespeare"
"HORATIO My lord, I think I saw him yesternight."	"shakespeare"
"But since, so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England, Are here arrived give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view; And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about: so shall you hear Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause, And, in this upshot, purposes mistook Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I Truly deliver."	"shakespeare"
"LORD POLONIUS Give first admittance to the ambassadors; My news shall be the fruit to that great feast."	"shakespeare"
"ROSENCRANTZ Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stagesso they call themthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither."	"shakespeare"

"Lord The king and queen and all are coming down."	"shakespeare"
"There is a play to-night before the king; One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which I have told thee of my father's death: I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech, It is a damned ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy."

"Gentleman She speaks much of her father; says she hears There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart; Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt, That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing, Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection; they aim at it, And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts; Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them, Indeed would make one think there might be thought, Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily."

"QUEEN GERTRUDE Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general: but it wasas I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of minean excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning."

"MARCELLUS What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Ay, madam, it is common."	"shakespeare"
"LAERTES Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet It is our trick; nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will: when these are gone, The woman will be out."	"shakespeare"
"KING CLAUDIUS Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern."	"shakespeare"
"ROSENCRANTZ Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother, Popp'd in between the election and my hopes, Thrown out his angle for my proper life, And with such cozenageis't not perfect conscience, To quit him with this arm?"	"shakespeare"
"Exit Ghost MARCELLUS 'Tis gone, and will not answer."	"shakespeare"
"In the corrupted currents of this world Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above; There is no shuffling, there the action lies In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd, Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, To give in evidence."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET And therefore as a stranger give it welcome."	"shakespeare"
"How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!"	"shakespeare"
"Then I'll look up; My fault is past."	"shakespeare"
"The cease of majesty Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel, Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by."	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET We'll ha't to-morrow night."	"shakespeare"
"Dies HORATIO Now cracks a noble heart."	"shakespeare"
"HORATIO Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder."	"shakespeare"
"What players are they?"	"shakespeare"
"how infinite in faculty!"	"shakespeare"
"Enter Sailors First Sailor God bless you, sir."	"shakespeare"
"Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS KING CLAUDIUS Love!"	"shakespeare"
"HAMLET Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief."	"shakespeare"
"LORD POLONIUS At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him: Be you and I behind an arras then; Mark the encounter: if he love her not And be not from his reason fall'n thereon, Let me be no assistant for a state, But keep a farm and carters."	"shakespeare"
"MARCELLUS Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently."	"shakespeare"
